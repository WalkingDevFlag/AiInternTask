        "summary": "Held,  that the workmen were not  entitled to  puja  bonus  as an implied term of employment for  an  implied  agreement  could not be inferred when  the appellant had  made  it  clear  that  the payments  from  1948  to  1952  were  ex  gratia ;  but  they  were entitled to puja bonus on  the basis that it  was  a  customary  and traditional payment. (i)  that the payment has been made over  an unbroken series (ii)  that  it  has  been  for  a  sufficiently  long  period,  the period has to be  longer than in  the  case  of  an  implied  term of employment; (iii)  that it has been  paid even in years  of  loss  and  did  not (iv)  that the  payment  has  been  made  at  a  uniform  rate The \u00b7 company replied that payments in past years had been entirely ex gratia and as there was  loss in 1953 it  was not possible to make any ex gratia payment that  year. The company's case was that payment of bonus had all along been ex gratia depending upon  profits  except in a  few years. Therefore,  there was  neither  a  term  of  employment  nor any custom, obligation on the company to  pay  any bonus.in a  year of loss. sidered the  remaining  two  aspects,  namely,  whether puja  bonus  could  be  awarded  either  as  an  implied term  of  employment  according  to  the  decision  in M ahalakshmi Cotton Mills Ltd., Calcutta v.  M ahalakshmi Cotton  Mills  Workers'  Union (g)  or  on  the  basis  of custom. The decision of the Appellate Tribunal has  also mixed  the two aspects of puja bonus, namely,  whether it is based on an implied term of employment or on custom;  but it  came  to  the  conclusion  that  there  was  sufficient evidence  to  establish  custom  and  therefore  ordered payment of one month's basic wages  as puja bonus. It was  also  inclined  to  the  view  that  the  company's accounts showing loss were not reliable and there might even  be  a  case  for profit  bonus;  but  eventually it granted one  month's basic  wages  as  customary  puja bonus. Thereupon  the  company filed  an  application for  special leave to  appeal  to  this Court,  which  was allowed;  and  that  is  how  the  matter  has  come  up before us. Puja is a special festival  of  particular importance in Bengal ; and it has become usual with many firms  there to  pay  their  employees  bonus  to  meet  special  puja expenses. Disputes have arisen with respect to this bonus which were adjudicated npon by various tribunals. for  back  as  1949,  in  a  dispute betwe~  The  Bengdl Chamber  of  Commerce,  Calcutta and Its Employees('), the Industrial  Tribunal,  which  adjudicated upon  the dispute,  observed  that  Durga  Puja  was  a  national festival  in  Bengal  and  it  was  customary  to  make presents to near and dear ones and to  relatives at  that time. As it was  difficult  for  poorly  paid  employees to  make  savings  out of the  monthly income  for  this purpose,  it,  therefore,  had  become  traditional  and customary in 'Bengal for employers to make a monetary grant at the time of the pujas. The Bengal Chamber of Commerce had not been  slow in appreciating this  and had been  granting  bonus equivalent  to  one  month's pay, and the tribunal had been assured that there was no intention to discontinue it. That case, however, was concerned with puja bonus as an implied term of employment and not as a  matter of tradition  or custom  in  Bengal. In  the  face'  of  such  notice  year  by  year  it would not be possible to imply a  term  of employment on the basis of an  implied  agreement,  for  agreement postulates a meeting of minds  regarding  the  subject matter  of  an  agreement;  and  here  one  party  was always making it clear that the payment was ex  gratia and that  it  would  not  form  a  precedent  for  future years. In dealing with puja bonus  based  on  an 'implied term of employment, it was  pointed out by us in  Messrs. lspahani  Employees' Union (1 )  that a  term may be  implied, even though the payment  may  not  have  been  at  a  uniform  rate throughout  and  the  Industrial  Tribunal  would  be justified in deciding  what should  be  the  quantum  of payment in a  particular  year taking into account  the varying payments made in pr1;1vious  years. It  will  be seen that these tests  are in  substance  more  stringent than the tests applied for proof  of  puja  bonus  as  an implied term of employment. Let us now see  whether these  tests  are  satisfied  in the  present  case. It cannot therefore be said that there  was  any  break in the payment of bonus from  1940 to 1952,  for  if the chairman had not converted what was advance of pay into  bonus  in  December  1952,  the  workmen  might ha. Lastly, the condition that payment should  have  been at a  uniform rate has also been  satisfied  because  one month's basic wage is the quantum of bonus from  1940 right up to 1952 without any  change. It is true that the workmen pitched their  demand too high for three month's  bonus in 1953. As this  question  has  arisen  for  tlie  first time  in  this  Court  as  a  distinct  issue  and  was  not clearly considered  before  by  the  Appellate  Tribunal, we  order the parties to bear their own  costs.",

        "summary": "Patntalal Jankid-:u v, Mohanlal and Another, Both  sec tion  14  and section  18  have in  view  the  physical cause for  the loss  or damage to  property  for  which  compen sation  is  claimed and not  the cause  of  action  in  rela tion  to  the person against whom  relief  is  sought. The respondents  cannot,  in  my opinion,  be allowed  to  take up inconsistent  positions in  order  to  bring themselves within the one  and to get out of  the other. Agent for  the appellants:  Mohan  Behari  Lal. It is  not  p1\u00b7oper  to  depart  fron1  this rule  of law Incnme-tax, as it will  convert the  High  Court  into  a  fact  finding  authority,  Wcst  Bengal which  it is  not, under the  advisory  jurisdiction. In  their  assessment  fio  income-tnx  the  assessees  claimed  that  the amounts  so  deducted  should  bo  excluded  from  their  asRessable income  as  business cxpenditme under s. 10 (2)  (xv)  of  tbe Income tax  Act. argued,  relying  on  the  case  cf  Mitchell  v.  B.  W.

Judgment of  the Calcutta High Court  reversed. Galcu~~/Y'\"'Y dated  9th  Septern ber,  1949,  in  a  reference  under section 66  (2)  of  the  Indian  Income-tax  Act,  1922. S.  Mitra  (B.  Banerjee,  with  him)  for  the respond pronounced  on  a  reference  made to  it by  the  Income.tax  Tribunal  under  section 66 (2)  of the  Indian  Income.tax Act. The respondents are a  private limited company which  was  brought  into  existence  to  float  various companies including cotton mills. In November,  1932, the  Basanti  Cotton  Mills  Ltd.  was  incorporated and the respondents  were  appointed  their managing agents. Their remuneration was  fixed  at a  monthly allowance of  Rs. on  all gross sales  of goods  manufactured  by  the Mills  Company. The  Nath  Bank  Ltd.  claimed  payment  of these  hundis. pondent company  entered  into an agreement  with  the  w .. t  Bengal Mill  Company, the material part of  the terms  of  which rnns as  follows  \u00b7- Calcutta Agency  Limited  of  the one  part and Basanti  Kama c.  J. 1,80 000 or any part there- of  AND  WHEREAS  the said Nath Bank Ltd. there- upon  instituted  four  suits  in  High  Court  being  suit Nos. The  assessee  company claimed this before  the  Income-tax  Appellate Tribunal  as a deduc- tion  permitted  under section  IO  (2)  (xv)  of  the  Indian Income-tax Act. (1)  \"The tax shall  be  payable by  an assessee Kania o. J.  under  the  head  'Profits  and  gains  of  business,  pro fession  or  vocation' in  respect of the profits or gains of any  bminess,  profession  or  vocation  carried  on  by him. (2)  Such  profits  or gains  shall be computed  after .................................... (xv)  any  expenditure  (not  being  in  the  nature of  capital  expenditure  or  personal  expenses  of  the assessee)  laid out or  expended  wholly  and exclusively for  the  purpose  of  such business,  profession or voca tion.\" The first argument was that under  the  first  proviso  to  section 7  of  the Indian Income-tax Act,  this payment was liable  to  be exempted. 22,500 it was  entitled to exemption  under  section 10(2)  (xv)  of  the Income-tax  Act on  the  ground  that the payment was  an  expenditure which  was not  in the nature of  a  capital expenditure or personal expenses  of the applicant company but  was  an  expenditure  laid out wholly  and exclusively for the  purpose of  its  busi ness. They  urged that if the  applicant  company  did not agree  to  pay  this  amount,  Basanti  Cotton  Mills Ltd.  could have brought a  suit  against  the  company to realise  this amount due on  the hundis which  would sion  due  to  it  and  thereby  brought  it  within  the  West  ,Bengal principles of  the decision of  1Vlitchell  v.  B.  W.  Noble  Oalcutt. was  passed against the  applicant  company  evidently for  certain misfeasance  committed by its  directors  and the  applicant  company agreed  to pay  it  off  from  its remuneration. (3)  The books  of  account  of  Basanti Cotton  Mills  Ltd. would show  that  they  were  paying the  applicant company  in  full  its  remuneration  and the books  of  the  applicant company also  show  that  it (4)  In  the was  entitled to its  remuneration  in  full. (5)  Besides,  the  Tribunal was  of  the  opinion  that  in  this  case  it  was  not  a revenue expenditure at  all. On  behalf of  the  res- pondent  it was  argued  in the  further  alternative  that the  Privy  Council  decision  in  Raja  Bijoy  Singh Dudhuria's  easel.') That contention was  rejected by the Tribunal. e  app ican  company  o Oa!cutt. The  High  Court thereafter  noticed  several  cases  including  111 itchell' s case(') and towards  the close  of the judgment delivered by Chatterjea J.  observed as  follows:-\"In this  case  it is  clear that the agreement  was entered into with a view to avoid the publicity of an action  against  the  mana ging agents and consequent  exposure and scandal  and in order to maintain  the managing agency so  that  the company could carry on  its  business  as  before. The payment in  question  did  not  bring in  any  new  assets into existence nor in  my opinion  can  it  properly  be said that it  brought  into existence an advantage for the enduring benefit of the company's trade. ment was to enable the company  to  remove  a defect in carrying on the business of  the company  and  to  earn profits  in its  business. The  Commissioner  of  Income.tax, West Bengal,  has come  in  appeal to us. Now  it is  clear that this  being a  claim for exemption of an amount,  contended to  be  an  expenditure  falling under  section  10(2)(xv),  the burden  of  proving  the necessary  facts  in  that connection  was  on  the assessee, 1950 -:--:- it being common ground that the commission  was  due ;'\"  of and  had become payable and was therefore the business cc7m\"\" 0 ,;. Any  departure from  this rule of law  will convert  the  High  Court into a fact-finding  authority,  which  it is  not  under  the advisory  jurisdiction. ment  of  facts  by  the  parties  on  which  the  High Court has to pronounce  its judgment. Surprisingly,  we  find  that the  High  Court,  in its judgment, has taken the  argument of  Mr.  Mitra as if  they  were  facts  and  have  based  their  conclusion solely  on  that  argument. In  our  opinion this  is  an  entirely  wrong  approach  and  should  not have been  permitted  by  the  High  Court. 5,582 as a  permissible  deduction  under section  10 (2)  (iii)  of the Income-tax Act. That claim  was rejected  by  the Income-tax Officer. '22,500) should be  treated as  not earned or deemed to be earned by the assessees at all,  having regard  to  the  decision of the Privy Council  in Raja  Bijoy Singh  Dudhuria's case. statement:-\" In disallowing this  (interest)  claim  the Income-tax Officer  was  following  the  decision  of my predecessor in his order dated  the  18th March  1942  in Oommimoner  0! My  predecessor obser- ~:~\u00b7;;~~~1 ved:  \"Nothmg 1s m evidence to show that the managmg v. agency  company had surplus money  and  such  money  Calcutta Ag\u2022\u2022cv \u00b7 was  invested or that there  was  any  need  to  borrow. Thus the need  to borrow is  not  established. 22,500  as  allowable  expenditure  being  alloca tion of  a sum out of the revenue receipt before it became income  in the hands of  the assessee.\" Reliance  was placed for  this  contention on  Raja Bijoy Singh Dudhuria's case('). At  the third stage,  when  the assessee  urged  his  conten tions  before  the  Income  Tax  Appellate Tribunal,  he thought of urging as  an argument  that this  was  a per missible  deduction  under  section 10  (2)  (xv)  because of the  principles  laid  down  in  Mitchell's  case(2). No evidence,  it  appears,  was  led  before the Income  Tax Tribunal, nor has  the  Tribunal recorded  any  findings of fact on  which the principles  laid down  in  Mitchell's case(')  could be applied. It is  therefore  clear  that the  necessary facts  required  to  be  established  before the principles laid  down  in  Mitchell's  case( 2 )  could  be applied,  have not  been found  as  facts  in the present case  at any stage of  the  proceedings  and  the  High  Court  was  in error in  applying  the  principles of Mitchell's  case(1)  on the assumption of  facts  which were  not proved. Calcutta  Agenoy  urged before the Income-tax  Officer it would have seen at once that the argument was  in  a  measure conflicting\u00b7 with  that  contention  which  was  based  on  the foot- ing  of  Rs. 1,80,000  being  a  loan  to  the  assessee  on which  it  had to pay  interest,  which  was  sought to  be deducted  under  section  10 (2)  (iii)  of  the  Income-tax Act. therefore,  this appeal should be allowed on the simple  ground  that the facts necessary to  be  established  by the respondents to support their claim  for  exemption  under  section  10 (2)  (xv)  of  the Indian Income-tax  Act  have  not been established  at any  stage  of  the  proceedings  and  therefore they are not entitled to  the  deduction  claimed.",

        "summary": "On  his  search  by the customs authorities a  sum  of  Rs. 25,000  was  recovered  from him which  he  had not declared in  his  declaration  form  and  for which he  had no  permit  from  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  for taking out of  India. On September 16,  1952,  Mitra  applied  to  the  Magistrate  for  a search warrant and for  a  warrant  of  arrest  and  both  warrants were issued. tho  appellant atte1npted  to  take  out of  India  the  currency  notes  in  question, and  such  attc1npt  \\Vas  also  an  offence. hlA\\I  .T.-This is  an appeal on  a  curtificatfl  granted liy  the  ( 'rileutt:t High Court. Narayandas Bhagwandas JY!adltavda< v. The State  of West  Bengal The prosecution case was that on  September 7, 1952, the  appellant went to  Dum Dum  Aerodrome  with  a view to boarding a  plane  for  Hong Kong. The  Cwitoms  Officers, however,  noticed a  pouch of  somewhat  unusual -size\u00b7 which  aroused their suspicion. Thereafter,  the appel lant  was  subjected to  personal  search. Mitra  thereupon  applied  to  the Additional  District, Magistrate on September 16, 1952, for a search warrant This was also  allowed  and a  warrant of  arrest was issued by the Additional  District  Magistrate  and appellant was thereafter :irrested  and released on bail with  a  direction to a ppcnr before the  Additional Dis trict Magistrate on Septmnber 19. He  was  sentenced to pay a  fine  of Rs. l,OOQ,  in default to suffer  rigorous imprisonment for  three  months. the complaint on February 2,1953,could not make legal proceedings which  had  already  commenced  without jurisdiction. The Customs Officers instead of giving him a receipt falsely charged him with smuggling the currency notes out of India without any  permit. According to the appellant, he had applied  to  the  Reserve Bank of India at Calcutta for a  permit and had sent an a pplica tion for that  purpose  to one  Joshi in  Calcutta. He had at no time  any  intention  to  carry out of India the said currency notes  without a  permit. The High  Court, however,  did not accept his version. It was urged that the appeal is before us on a certific ate apd as  the  High  Conrt  had  come  to  a  different We can see  no  particular  reason in  this case  to go be hind the findings  of fact arrived at by the High Court. An  important  circumstance  which  might have supported the appellant's  case,  namely  whether he had applied to the Reserve  Bank of India for a per mit to take out of India currency notes  to the  extent of Rs. The  High Court came  to  the conclusion that there  was  no evidence  to  show;  that any such application was writen or submitted on  Sep tember 2,  1952. It  does  seem  extraordinary  that  if the appellant  had  sent  the  application  to  Joshi  on September 2,  1952,  that Joshi should not have sent on that application to the Reserve Bank till September 15, 1952. connection on  September 15  and  16,  1952,  Inspector Mitra of  the  Special  Police  Establishment,  Calcutta had applied for  a  search warrant and a  warrant i;if ar rest respectively against the appellant. It is inconceivable that a  person who  was leav ing for Hong Kong and wished to  carry  such  a  large sum of money as  Rs. It is impossible to believe that he had arrivea at Calcutta and had gone direct to the Dum Dum Aero drome without making any enquiry from Joshi at least whether the permit asked for had been granted. Norm a.lly one would  expect the appellant to reach  Calcutta. in  sufficient  time  to  make  the  necessary  enquiries and in the absence  of a permit having been granted to have left the currency notes for safe custody with Joshi or some other trusted person. It is significant that  the  appellant  did  not examine Joshi as a  witness in support of his case. It is not uv!ikely that if he  had done so  some  inconvenient results  would  have  followed  in  consequence  of.close questioning of Joshi regarding' the  entire  transaction. 25,000, at  the  customs barrier but was searched when the customs formalities were gone through is not only deposed to by a  number of witnesses holding responsible positions but is deposed to by P.\\V. Panna  Lal  Dey's evidence was accepted by the High Court and after having examined\u00b7 his evidence we  are satisfied that there is  no reason  to distrust his testimony. It  is  true  that  the  appellant  had  not  taken  the currency  notes  in  question  out  of  India  across any customs frontier as defined by the.Central Government. He had, however, clearly attempted to take  the  same out of India. In such a  case no  question of his crossing the customs frontier arises. The Foreign Exchange Regulation (Amendment) Act l!J52 (VIII of 1952), came into force  in :February 1952. Section  23B  makes  punishable  an  attempt  to  con travene  the  proYisions  of  the  Foreign  Exchange Regulation  Act  or  any  rule,  direction or order made thereunder. Furthermore,  this  point  was  not taken before  the  Bench  which  granted  the  certificate  of fitness for  appeal to this Court. Be that as it may, tlie facts  found  clearly  established  that  the  appellant attempted to take out of India the  currency  notes  in question. He  was  asked  to  pick  up  his trousers and wear them again. 25,000, in currency notes out of India without a  permit from  the  Reserve  Bank. In order to ascertain this certain provisions  of  the  Foreign  Exchange  Regulation  Act and the Code  of Criminal Procedure  will  require  con sideration. Under  s.  19(3)  of  the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act a  District Magistrate or  Magistrate  of the first  class may, on a representation in writing m.ade by a  person authorized in this  behalf  by  the  Central Government  or the Reserve Bank and having reasons to believe that there had been contravention of any of the  provisions  of that  Act,  issue  a  search  warrant. On September  16,  Mitra  applied  for  a  warrant  of arrest against the appellant. This application was obviously made under the Criminal Procedure Code. definitely states that  he  in  asking  for  permission  to investigate  a  non-cognizable  offence  under  s.  155, Cr. It  was  necessary  therefore  for Inspector Mitra to obtain from  the  Additional District Magistrate a  warrant of arrest. It  is  clear,  therefore, that upto September 16,  1952,  the  Additional  District Magistrate had not taken cognizance of any  offence. In  the mean time, on January 27,  1953,  Inspector  Mitra  had  been authorized under s.  23(3)(b) of  the  ]foreign  Exchange Regulation Act  to  file  a  complaint. empowered) for favour of dis posal according to law. By  his  subsequent  orders  time  for investigation was  further  extended  until  February 2, 1953. It  was,  however,  argued  that when Mitra applied for a  search  warrant  on  Septem ber, 16,  1952, the Additional  District  Magistrate  had recorded an order thereon,  \"  Permitted. We cannot agree with this submission because the  petition of Inspector Mitra clearly states that \" As this is  non cognize.ble offence, I Pf. Magi strate to issue a warrant of arrest and his order directing the  issue  of  such  a  warrant cannot also be regarded as orders which indidate  that  the  Additional  District Magistrate thereby took cognizance of the  offence. In order to facilitate  his investigation it was necessary for  him to arrest the appellant and that  he  could  not do without a  warrant  of  arrest  from  the  Additional District Magistrate. It could not be said with any good reason that the Additional District Magistrate had either on September 16,  or at any sub sequent date upto February 2, 1953, applied his \u00b7mind to the case with a  view  to  issuing a  process against the appellant. The Additional District  Magistrate,  however,  must  be  regarded  as having taken cognizance on this date because he  sent the case to Mr.  Sinha  for  trial. The  Magistrate  would  not  be required to, pass  any  further. It is only at this stage that the Additional District Magis trate would be called upon to make up his mind whether he would take cognizance of the offence. The following  observation  by  Das Gupta, J., in the case of  S'uperintendent  and  Remem brancer of Legal  Affairs,  West  Bengal  v.  Abani  Kumar Banerji (1)  was approved by this Court in the  case  of R.R. \"What is ta.king cognizance  has not been  defined  in the Criminal Procedure Code  and. It  seems  to  me  clear  however that before it can be said that any magistrate has taken cognizance  of  any  offence  under  section  190(l}(a) Criminal  Procedure  Code,  he  must  not  only  have applied his mind to the  contents  of  the  petition  but muRt  have done so for the purpose of proceeding  in  a particular way as indicated in  the  subsequent  provi sions  of  this  Chapter-proceeding  under  section  200 and thereafter  sending it for inquiry and report under section 202. other kind,  e.g.,  ordering  investigation  under  section 156(3),  or issuing a  search warrant for  the  purpose  of. It is,  however, argued that in Chari's  case  this  Court was  dealing  with  a  matter  which  came  under  the Prevention of Corruption Act. As  to  when  cognizance  is  taken  of  an offence  will depend upon the  facts  and  circumstances of each case and it is impossible  to  attempt  to  define Issuing of a what  is  meant  by  taking  cognizance.",

        "summary": "A  public  notice  under s.  22(1)  of  the\u00b7 Income-tax  Act,  1922 was published on  May  r,  1945,  requiring every person whose  total income exce'eded  the  niaximum  amount  \\vhich  \\\\'as not  charge able  to  inco1ne-tax  to file  returns for the assr!ismcnt  year 1945-46. On  January  5,  1950,  the  assessee  submitted  a  voluntary  return ,shOY\\ting  an  inco1ne  of  Rs .. 1,935  for  the  :issessmcnt  year  1945-46 and adde<l  a  footnote  to  the  return that his  wife ha<l sold  her  old ornaments  and  deposited  a  sum  of  Rs. 59,026  with  the Assar Syndicate in  \\Yhich  he  \\Vas  a  partner. On  lllarch  J4, I950,  the assessce  submitted an  identical  return.

Appeal from the jwlgment and or<ler datPd :\\larch 18, in  Income-tax fitness  granted  by  the  High  Court  of  Judicature at Bombay has been filed  by the CommisRioner of Income- tax,  Bombay  against  Ranchhoddas  Karsondas. The  assessee  dicl  not  make  a return of );is income. Officer  could take any action, the assessee submitted  a r959 \"voluntary\"  return on January 5,  1950 of his income - . The  Income-tax  Officer  did  not  act  on  this  return, but on February 27, 1950 he issued a  notice purporting to be under s.  34 of the Act calling  upon  the  assessee to submit his return. His contentions were  three,  viz.,  that  the amount of Rs. after  the assessee  had filed  a  voluntary  return was valid in  law ? This  reference  was  heard  by  the  High  Court  on March 18,  1954,  and  by  a  judgment delivered on the  . :;-:;1ah,  J. Conrt, it  was  again  contended  by  the  assessee  that since he  had  submitted  a  return under s.  22(3)  of the Act on January 5,  1950,  the  assessment,  if  any,  had to be completed before March  31,  1! He  alRo  contended  that  he  was entitled under s.  22(3)  to make  [t  \"  voluntary\"  return on the date he  did, and with  a  voluntary return before the  Income-tax  Officer,  there  was  no  scope  for  the issuance of a  notice  under s.  34. The  High  Court granted a certificate of fitness, and  hence this  appeal. 1g 1  ourt a  so  enter- t  a  at  one  t.nne  t  e  ~a rmtta tained the view that such a,  return was no return at all, but it was  expl1tined  later  that  this  me,tnt  that  the return  was ineffective for  the purposes of s.  22(1) of tlw Act,  though  it  might  he  IL  \"return\"  being  in  the prescribed form.

(a)  the  Income-tax  Officer  has  reason to believe that.by reason of the omission or failure\u00b7 on the part of an assessee to make a  return of his income  under section 22,  for  any year ...... , or (b)  notwithstimrling  that there has  been no omis sion or failure  as mentioned  in clause (a)  on the part of the assessee,  the Income-tax  Officer  has  in  con sequence  of information  in his possession reason  to believe that income,  profits  or  gains  chargeable  to income-tax have escaped assessment for  any year ... * he may in cases falling  under clause (a)  at  any  time within eight years and in cases  falling  under  clause (h)  at any time 'vithin four  years of the  end of that year, serve on the assessee ... a  notice ... and  may proceed to assess such income ... \" It would appear from  this that if the return filed  on January 5,  1950, was a  return of income,  there was no failure  or omission  on the part of the asscssee,  so as to bring the matter within s.  34(l)(a) of the Act, and sub s.  (3)  of s.  34 would then apply to the case limiting the period to four  years. In  that  event,  the  a:;sessmcnt should  have  been  completed  on  or  before  March 31, 19b0. In  that  event,  the  asses:mient  would be  valid.

(l) ti.ml  (2)  and the failure  or  omis sion  occurs  when  that  period  passes,  but  sub-s  (3) :;i,llows  a  locus  poen:itentiae  before  the  assessment  is actually made. There is  no disput_e  that a  return could be  filed  in  this  case,  late  though  it  was. Courts, the leading cases in Bombay being Harakchand Makanji &  Do. v.  Oommiss-ioner  of  Income-tax (1),  All  The Commission\" India  Groundnut  Syndicate  Ltd.  v.  Commissioner  of  of Income-tu, Income-tax (2)  and the decision under appeal here, while Bombay the Calcutta view is to  be  found  in  Commissioner  of v. Agricnltural Income-tax v. Sultan Ali Gharami (3)  R. K. Ranchhoddas Karsondas, Bombay Das &  Go. To these  Hiday~ah J. may  be  added  P.  S.  Rlima  Iyer v.  C01nmi.ssioner  of Income-tax (6 ),  in  which  the  Madras  High  Court has accepted the Bombay view. In some  of them,  the point  need  not have been taken up for  decision,  though it was. We shall refer  very briefly to  the two rival  views and  the grounds on which they are rested,  and in doing so,  we In  Sultan  Ali begin  with  the  Calcutta  decisions. Gharami's case  (3 ),  a  notice under s. 24(1) of the Bengal Agricultural Income-tax Act  (corresponding to s.  22(1) of the Act)  was  issued. Three years  later,  a  notice  under  s.  24(2)  of  that  Act (corresponding to s.  22(2)  of the Act)  was served,  and a  return  showing  an  income  below taxable minimum was filed. (as  he then was)  and Das Gupta, J., held  that a  person  who had  no  assessable  income  was  not  placP-d  under  a duty to file  a  return,  that  the  return  whether  filed under s.  24(1)  or  s.  24(3)  which  had failed to show  an assessable income could not  possibly be  'treated'  as a return  under s.  24(1)  or  even  s.  24(3)  when  filed  in answer to a  notice under s.  24(2). the return he offers that income  for  assessment. A person who  had no assessable income in the previous year is placed  under  no  duty  by  a  notice  under section 24(1) to furnish a  return and  a  person  who thinks, rightly or wrongly,  that he had no assessable income will  furnish  none. A return  under  section 24(1),  whether filed  within  the  time  allowed  under the section  or  filed  subsequently  under  the  provi sions of section 24(3),  will  therefore  show an  asses sable income ... A return which showed no assessable income, could not possibly be  'treated'  as  a  return filed  under section 24(1)  or a  return called for  under that section but filed  under  section  24(3),  when  in fact it was filed  in response to a notice under section 24(2).\" \"  'It should be remembered',  I  observed  'that the return in  the  present  case  is  being  sought  to  be treated as a  return  under  section  24(1),  belatedly filed.' And then I  went  on  to  say  that  a  return under section 24(1) would only  be  filed  by  a  person who thought  that  he  had  a  taxable  income  and therefore  a  return  showing  an  income  below  the taxable limit could not be  held,  on  a  construction thereof,  to  be  a  return  under  section  24(1)  and consequently the return  in  the  case  we  were  then considering could not  be  treated  as  such  a  return filed  under section 24(3). To say  that,  was  not  to say  that  even a  return  filed  in  compliance  with a notice under  section 22(2),  if filed  belatedly  under section  22(3)  could  not  be  a  return  showing  an income below the taxable limit.'' This left the matter somewhat ambiguous as to what was really meant,  and  in  Commissioner  of Income-f,ax v. GovindlaJ,  Dutta('), Chakravarti, C.  J., and Guha, J., e  ommsssioner the  amendment of 1953, and observed that under that 0 ,  Incom 6-tas '  Bombay section a  person was required  to  file  a  return  only  if his total income during  the  preceding  year  exceeded v. the maximum amount  which  was  not  chargeable  to Ranchhoddas tax. The learned  Judges  concluded that it was a complete  mistake  to  think that  s.  22(3) provided for the filing  of a  voluntary  return  showing loss,  at any  time,  before  assessment. It  lays down  that  the public notice requires only persons  having  an income above the  taxable  limit to  make a  return. It is a  little  difficult  to  understand  how  the  exist ence  of  a  return  can  be  ignored,  once  it  has  been filed. taxable limit can be made  even  in answer  to  a  notice  under s.  22(2). No  dout>t,  under  that  sub-section  only those persons a.re  required  to  make  a  return,  whose income  is  above  taxable  limits,  but  a  person  may legitimately consider himself entitled to certain deduc tions and allowances,  and yet  file  a  return  to be  on the  safe  side. to  be  above the exempted hm1t,  No doubt,  it is futile for  a  person  not liable to  tax\u00b7 to  rush in with a  return, but the return  in  law  is  not a  mere  scrap of  paper. It is  a  return,  such  as  the  assessee  considers,  repre We are unable (and we  say  this  with  due  respect} to accept  the view ad,.umbrated  in the  Calcutta  cases. \"Notice under section 34  is  only necessary  if  at t.he  end of the assessment year  no  return  has  been made by  the assessee, and the authorities  wished  to proceed  under  section 22(2),  but where the  assessee himself  chooses  voluntarily  to  make  a  return,  no question can  arise  under  section  34  of  assessment escaping,  and  therefore  there  is  no  necessity  to 8erve  any notice  under section 34.\" A  return  in  answer  to  that notice could be filed  under s.  22(3)  before assessment, It was filed  on and for  this there is no limit of time. It was open to  him,  if  there  wa.s  sufficient  justification for it,  to hold that  the amount noted in  the  footnote was  really  the  assessee's  income,  in  which  case  an assessable income would have been found and the  tax could  be charged thereon. before  March  31,  1950,  the  assessment  would  have been valid. He chose to ignore the return, and served on tie assessee a  notwe  ~n er  s. is  notice was  improper,  because  with  the  return  already  filed there  was  neither  an  omission  nor  a  failure  on  the part  of  the  assessee,  nor  was  there any  question  of  Ranchkoddas assessment 'escaping'. vVe  accordingly agree  with the judgment under  appeal. Before leaving this case,  we  may  refer  to two other arguments, whieh were raised. :Further,  all  laws  of limitation to  some  inconvenience  and  hard lead cases. The short answer to that is  that this was not  a  part  of  the  Department's  case  at  any  prior stage, and  cannot be allowed to be raised now. The appeal thus fails,  and  is  dismissed  with  costs.",

        "summary": "953,  that  the  approver's evidence had to  satisfy a  double  test  i.e.,  he  must be a reliable witness and his evidence must receive sufficient corroboration and in that the corroborating evidence  was  not  sufficient  to  connect the appellant with the crime. Held,  that there were no  misdirections in  the  charge. The observations in Sarwan Singh's  case that  it must be  shown that the approver was a  reliable  witness  were  made  in  the  special circumstances of  that case where the approver had definitely been found  to be so thoroughly discrepant  as to be  wholly  unreliable. IMAM  J.-The appellant was sentenced to  imprison ment for  life  under s.  302  by  the  Sessions  Judge  of Birbhum who agreed with the majority verdict  of  the jury that he was guilty. He appealed against his con viction to the Calcutta High Court. About a  month previous to  the  date  of  occurrence the appellant had made a  proposal' to her that she should live  with  him which  was rejected. Accord ingly he murdered Sibapada Hati on the May 26, 1955. Unless there  was a  mis direction or non-direction amounting to a  misdirection in the charge to the jury which, in fact, had occasioned a  failure of justice  the jury's verdict must prevail and J nanendra  Nath Ghose v. The  State of West  Bengal on approver's  evidence,  it  is  a settled  rule  of  practice  not  to convict a  person on such  evidence  except  under  very  rare and excep tional  circumstanc~s. and  usua!lv  substantial  cor roboration is required. I, therefore, warn you, gentle men,  that  it  is  highly  dangerous  to  convict  on approver's evidence alone. There can,  no  doubt be legal  conviction  upon  the  uncorroborated  evi a dence  of  an  accomplice  and,  as  already  stated, the  uncorroborated testimony  of  an  accomplice  is strictly admissible  and a  conviction based on it alone is  not illegal, yet you  should remember,  gentlemen, that experience teaches us  that an accomplice  being always an infamous person, he having thrown to the wolves  his associates and friends in order to save his own skin and,  though  criminal,  has  purchased  his liberty by betrayal, his  evidence  must  be  received with very great caution  and  it is highly  dangerous to  act  upon  his  evidence  unless  it  is  materially corroborated. I  must also  tell you  that this rule as to corroboration has become a  settled  rule  of  prac tice of so universal an  application that  it  has  now almost the  force  and reverence of  law. ]  nanendra N alll Chose v. The State of West  Bengal In other words, it must be evidence which implicates him, that is,  which conforms in some material parti culars not only the evidence that the crime has been committed  but  also  that  the  prisoner  (accused) committed  it. In  the  present  case,  a previous  statement of an approver, viz., the confes sion  has  been  made  exhibit  before  you,  but that previous statement, you are further to bear in mind, cannot  r.orroborate  his  latter statement,  viz.,  the statements that have  been  made by him before you \u00b7 in this  Court. In  dealing  with  the  question  what  amount  of corroboration is required you, gentlemen, must exer cise  careful  discrimination  and  look  at  all  the surrounding circumstances in  order  to  arrive  at  a conclusion  whether  the  facts  deposed  to  by  the approver Sastipada are  borne out by  those  circum- stances. \" It is true that in Sarwan Singh's case this Court had held,  \"The  appreciation  of  an  approver's  evidence has to satisfy a double test. It must show that he is a reliable witness and that his  evidence  receives  suffici ent corroboration and that is a  test which  is  common to all witnesses. If this test is  satisfied the second test which still remains to be applied is  that the approver's evidence must  receive  sufficient  corroboration. This test is special to the cases of  weak or tainted  evidence like that of the  approver.\" It seems to  us that if  it was  found  that  the  approver's  account  against one of the accused persons was wholly discrepant,  this j  nanendra  Nath Ghose v. The State of West  Bengal finding  itself should  inevitably  have led  the court  to scrutinise his  evidence in respect of the  other  accused persons  with  greater caution.\" Nothing has been  shown to us  in this  case, as  was shown  in  Sarwan  Singh's case that apart from the  approver's  testimony  in the present  case being  regarded  as  tainted  evidence his evidence  as  it  stood  was  in  any  way  unreliable. Indeed,  the  Sessions  Judge  went  to  the  length  of telling the jury that although an  approver's  evidence is  strictly  admissible  and  a  conviction is  not  illegal merely because it is based on  an approver's  evidence, it was a  settled rule of practice not to convict a person on such evidence  except under  very  rare  and  excep tional  circumstances  and  usually  substantial  cor roboratLm  was required. The jury could not have been more clearly warned about the danger of  acting  on an approver's evidence. case  can  be  distinguished Obviously, it was never suggested  that the  approver's evid~nce in  this  case was  entirely  unreliable,  if his evidence was tested in  the same  way as the  evidence of any  prosecution  witness  in  a  criminal  trial. J nanendra Nath Ghose v. The  Slate of West Ben.gal \"  We hold that evidence in corroboration must be independent testimony which  affects the accused by connecting or tending to  connect him with the crime. In other words, it must be evidence which implicates him, that is,  which confirms in some n;iaterial  parti cular not only the evidence that the  crime has been committed, but also that the prisoner  committed it. J nanendra Nath Ghose v. The Stale of West  Bengal There  should  be  corroboration  in  material particulars not only concerning the crime but corrobor ation  of  the  approver's  story  by  evidence  whi9h connects  or  tends  to  connect  an  accused  with  the crime. to Lila's house and had a  talk with the deceased. Jumntlra Nath Glwss v. The Slate of Wesl Bengal The medical evidence established that the appellant had an almost healed up ulcer t inch in length on the left side of the palm at its posterior surface one inch belowthewrist joint and another healed up ulcer iinch in length on the left thumb at the  posterior surface and that these injuries could be caused  by  a  sharp cutting weapon like a knife. As it had become night  and the deceased had not  returned,  Lila's  mother  Brojeswari  and  her uncle Radharaman  Sadhu  searched for  him. When enquiries were made  from  the  appellant  by Brojeswari he  first  replied  that  the  deceased  had not  gone  with  him  and  that  he  did  not  know anything  about  his  whereabouts. The jury  had  to  decide for themselves  whether  the  above-mentioned  circum stances were sufficient corroborative evidence to satisfy ] nantndra N allt Ghose v. The State of West Bengal The jury  were  entitled  to  accept this evidence as sufficient corroboration in  a.  material particular  connecting  the  appellant  or. Jnanmdra  Nath Ghose v.

        "summary": "Overtime  Wages-Claim  by  employees  in  railway  factory Validity-F actories  Act,  z948  (LXIII  of z948),  ss. z(l), 59-The Bombay  Shops  and  Establishments  Act,  z948  (Bom. These appeals by special leave arose from  applications  made by the respondents,  who were  employed  as  timekeepers  in  the time office  of  the Central Railway Workshop and Factory,  Parel, Bombay, claiming payment of overtime  wages under the Payment of  Wages Act, 1936 (4  of 1936). Appeals  by  special  leave  from  the judgments and order dated October 19, 1955  and January 31, 1956,  of the Authority under Payment of Wages  Act, Bombay, in Applications  Nos. All  these applications were  heard  by  the  Payment  of  Wages Authority, Bombay, as companion  matters  and  they have been disposed of by  a  common  judgment. The respondent's ca.se  wa.s that  he  was  entitled  to the overtime wages for work  on  such  Sundays  when he was not given a holiday within three  da.ys  prior to or three da.ys subsequent to the Sundays on  which  he worked. such he wa.s entitled to overtime wages under s  59 of the  said Act. Alternatively he urged that even if he wa.s not a worker within the meaning of s.  2(1)  of the  sa.id  Act, he would  neverthless  be  entitled  to  overtime  wages under the said s.  59  by reason of s.  70 of the  Bombay Shops and Establishments Act,  1948 (Bom. overtime  wages  was  made  by  the respondent on two alternative grounds. This work  consists in preparing the progress time-sheets and  operation  time-sheets  of machine-shop staff working on various jobs dealing with the production of railway spare parts. That  being  so,  we  think  it  is necessary first to consider the correctness of this view. We  would,  there fore,  deal with that question  first. It appears that there are three  statutes  which  pro vide  for  the  payment  of  extra. The proviso to s.  71 (c)  of the Indian Railways Act (IX of 1890) lays down that the exempted railway servant specified in  it  shall  be  pa.id  for  overtime  at not less than  one  and  a  quarter  times  his  ordinary rate  of pay. This  provision  has  been  subsequently amended by Act  59of1956, which makes the rate for overtime  one  and  one-half  times  the  ordinary rate of pay ;  but  it  is  common  ground that  we  are  not Section 63  of  the  Act  deals  with  this  topic ... It  is  clear  that  this  section  does  not apply to  the respondents  because they are employees in a.  factory  and  not  in  any  of  the  establishments enumerated in its two sub-sections. This  contention  has  been  upheld  by the Authority. Before  dealing  with  this  point  it  is  necessary  to refer  briefly  to  the broad  features of  the  Act. The Act no doubt  is  a  piece of beneficent social  legislation intended to serve the cause of labour  welfare. The definitions  of  com mercial  establishment  and  shop  exclude  inter  alia factory. Establishment is defind as meaning  a  shop, commercial establishment, residential hotel, restaurant, eating-house,  theatre or other place  of  public  amuse ment are entertainment to  which the  Act applies  and includes such other establishment as the State Govern ment may by notification in the official gazette declare to be  an  establishment for  the  purposes  of this  Act. It would be noticed that the definition of establishment is very wide,  and it does not purport  to be exhaustive because it  expressly empowers the  State  Government  c.  M.  Pradhan to  include  within  its  purview  by  notification  other  . Section 2,  sub-s. (6) Ga1endragadliar  J. defines an  employee  as meaning  a  person  wholly  or principally employed  in, and in  connection  with,  any establishment,  and  includes  an  apprentice  hut  does not include a  member of  the employer's family. 2(m) of the Factories Act defines a factory as meaning any premises including the precincts thereof- \"  (i)  whereon ten or  more  workers  are  working, or  were  working  on  any  day  of  the  preceding twelve  months,  and  in  any  part  of  which  a manufacturing  process  is  being carried on with the aid of power,  or is ordinarily so carried on,  or (ii)  whereon twenty or more workers are working, or were working on aiiy day of the preceding twelve months, and in  any  part of which a  manufacturing process is being carried on without the aid of power, or is  ordinarily so  carried on,- but does not include a  mine subject to  the  opera tion  of  the  Mines  Act,  1952 (XXXV of 1952), or a railway running shed;\" Separate  provisions  are  made  to  regulate Gajendragadkar  J. these  different  establishments  having  regard  to  the special needs of each one of them. There are, however, general provisions applicable  to and regulating all the establishments alike and  these are found in chs. We  have  already  noticed  that  in  defining  \"com mercial establishment\"  and  \"shop \"  respectively  the Act has expressly excluded  \" factories \"  from the said expressions. It is true that the definition of  \"establish ment\"  does  not  expressly  exclude  factory ;  but  it is plain that factory is  treated by the Act as separate and distinct and there can be no  doubt  that the provisions in  the  Act  which  apply  to  establishment  are  not In other intended to, and do  not,  apply  to factories. It  is  conceivable  that  a  kitchen attached to an  establishment  like  a  residential  hotel may  satisfy the definition  of  factory ;  but it seems to us that such an adjunct of an  establishment  is  prima facie  not intended by the Act to be treated  apart  and separately from  the main establishment  itself;  and  so it would be taken as a  part  of the  establishment  and be  governed by the  provisions  of  the Act  in  relation thereto. Section  4  provides  that  notwithstanding anything contained in the Act its provisions mentioned II  shall  not  apply  to the establishments, employees and other persons  men- 'd d tioncd against them in t  e secon  co  mun  o t  e  sai schedule. Indeed  as  we have already observed,  no provision of the Act except s. 70  applies to factories  and so  it would not  be  legiti- mate to base  any  argument  on  the  assumption  that s. 4 is  applioable  to the present case. II  are  wider than and different from the  establishment  as  defined  by s.  2(8). We do  not think that this suggestion  is  well-founded. 7  to 55  it  is only some provisions of the Act specified in col.  3 that are excluded. In other words,  the remaining sections not so  specified  would  apply  to  them. If that is so, they must be  and  are  establishments  under  s.  2(8)  of the Act. In this connection  it  must be  borne  in  mind  that s.  2(8)  empowers the State  Government  to  include by notification any office or institution within  the  defini tion of establishment;  and so the inclusion of any such office  or institution in col.  2 of sch. All  the  offices,  establishments  and  other institutions mentioned in col.  2 of sch. operation  of s.  4 excludes the application of s.  70 we have held that s.  4 applies only to establishments and not to factories. 4 is assumed to be applicable to factories, we do not think it would materially affect the  applica tion of s.  70. The plain  object  underlying s.  70  and its context emphatically point out that  it  is  intended to operate independently of the other provisions of the Act and in that sense it stands apart from them. Let  us  therefore, cite the said section and construe it. Section 70  provides that nothing in this Act shall be deemed to apply to any person employed in  or within the  precincts of  a  factory and the  provisions  of the Factories Act shall,  notwithstanding  anything in  the said Act, apply to such person. The Legislature knew that  in fact the Act contained  no provision which in terms or expressly applies to any such person;  but  in  order to remove  any  possible  doubt  it  has  provided that  no provision in the Act shall even  by inference or  fiction be deemed to apply to them. is intended to  clarify the position that though factory has been defined by s.  2(9)  of the Act, no  provision of the ct  is  inten  ed  to  be  applied  to  a.  factory  or employees  in  it. It is in reference to this  provision that s. 70  has provi ded t.liat notwithstanding the said provision the relevant provsions of the  Factories Act  will  apply  to  persons employed  in  a  factory. It has itself macb provision for the  payment of overtime wages to empoyees  in all  establishments by  s.  63 ;  and it  has made applicable inter alia  the  relevant  provisions  of the 1actories  Act in regard to  employees in  factories. Tha1 is the view which the Authority  has taken,  and in 01r  opinion its validity or correctness is not open to doult.",

I4  and  I9- Essential Commodities  Act,  I955  (IO of I955),  s.  3--Sugar (Control) Order,  I955. By a  notification  issued under the Sugar  (Control) Order, Thi! trnion  of India 1955, which  was made under\u00b7the Essential Commodities Act,  1955, the  Central  Government  increased  the  price of sugar for  internal sales by 50  nP.

The  loss,  if  any,  was  spread  over  many factories and was so  small as not to  amount to  an  unreasonable restriction. It would be  intolerable in any  legal system  that a  statute should  be  legal when the  Government  chose  to do a  thing  and  illegal  when it undid it and so on  from  time to  time at  the choice  of  the Govern ment.

If the sugar is delivered by a:-1  owner in accordance with the provisions of  this section, he retains no  rights in  such  sugar  except  his rights  to  receive \u00b7payment  therefor  under  s.  9 of the Act. Section  7 provides for  levy of additional excise duty on sugar despatched from the factory  for  consumption in India, if the owner of a  factory  does  not  fulfil  the demands under s.  6. \"(1)  Where sugar  delivered \u00b7by  any  owner  falls short of the export quota fixed  for it by  any  quantity (hereinafter  referred  to.

It may be pointed out that the Chief Director, Directorate  of  Sugar  and The  i:nion  of lndia Vanaspati,  Ministry  of  :Food  ttnd  Agriculture,  was specified  aH  such  in  a  notification issued on Juno 27, c 1958. We next proceed to the facts of these two cases. It was also stated  in  these  letters - that a  further  communication would  be  sent in due course  giving  detailed  despatch/ delivery/disposal  instructions  for  the  export  quota. Different  replies  were  sent  by  the  two  petitioners. (3)  The sale proceeds payable to us will be calculat Gmde  diffomntials  will  be  allowed  as  per  the Government  Notification  GSR.

Mills  to co-operate and let the  export agency  send  documents for  1,500 bags at Rs. Miils,  however, insisted  that  they were  unable to sell  sugar at the  controlled  rate,  and  that  as  they were  in  financial  difficulties,  it  was  not  possible  to honour  the  documents  as  suggested  by  the  export agency. Mills were requested to  retire  the  documents immediately,  as  funds  were needed urgently for  purchase of  additional  quantities for  export for It  enquired  the  name of the  bankers internal  sale. Mills were requested to  remit a sum of Rs. Mills and less \"on account\" payment of Rs. 10 per maund as indicated in the e&rlier  letters, Mills,  how ever,  did  not  agree  to this,  and  the  export  agency thereafter on December 18,  1958, sent  a  telegram that unless the drafts  were retired immediately,  the  quota sugar  should  be  kept  ready  for  despatch  so  that delivery might  be  taken  by  the export  agency. They  also stated that they were not able to  despatch more  than 500 bags, as  wagons  over  the Eastern  Railway  were limited. Mills  wired saying that the Banks were demand- Th  L  d  K  . twentyninth without prejudice  and to Ths Union  of India t av01  serious comp ica  ions we ms  rue  mg  an  waive interest. 9  of  1959)  was,  however,  filed  on January 27, 1959, that is to say, two days  earlier. Mills are as follows: After the letter  of August  24,  1958  was  sent,  nothing appears  to  have  been  heard  by  the  export  agency. 2,40,000  in the last season  and  another  loss  of Rs. 5,50,000 and that the  lease  money  amounting  to  Rs. They therefore, expressed their inability to send any sugar:  They also stated that if they  redeemed  the  pledged  sugar  even after paying the  \"on account\"  money  to  the  Bank, 15-2-0  per  maund less  than the controlled  price\u00b7  of  sugar. They further Ts\"'  LoMrd Ku,.,L\u00b7 htdna  stated that it was not possible  for  them  to  sell  sugar d . ugar at the  contro led  pnce  xed  y  t  e  Drrectorate  an ended by saying that they  were  not  in  a  position  to The  Union of India despatch sugar,  pointing  out  at  the  same  time  that the Act was unconstitutional and not binding on them. While matters  stood  at  this  stage  ~nd the S.  P. B. Mills  had  neither  paid  the  amount  demanded  nor agreed to despatch the sugar,  a  petition  was  filed  in this Court and a  temporary stay was obtained. They  contend  that if foreign  exchange is so  urgently needed, there should have been  uniform legislation  compelling  other  sugar manufacturers, who do not manufacture by the vacuum pan process,  also  to  export sugar. The  petitioners  further  contend  that manufacturers of  commodities  other  than  sugar  are not compelled to export  in  a  like  manner,  and  thus there is further discrimination. In our opinion,  this argument  is  without substance. That Entry,  if  interpreted  widely,  would  embrace  within The  Union  of India If we are to exist as  a  progressive  nation,  it  is  very necessary  that we  carve  out  a  place  for  ourselves  in  Hidayat,.llah J. the International  market. That the Central Government  has  selected  the  sugar  industry for an export programme does not mean that it cannot make a  classification  of the  commodities,  bearing  in mind  which  commodity  will  have  an  easy  market abroad for the  purpose  of  earning  foreign  exchange. During the  Suez  crisis,  sugar  was  exported  in  large quantities from  this  country,  and  earned 12\u00b74 crores as foreign  exchange. There is  nothing  on  the record to show that export of other commodities was not also undertaken, though it  was  pointed  out  in  arguments that  manganese  ore  was  also  exported  in  a  similar manner to earn foreign  exchange. It is  quite obvious that the Central Government cannot order the  export of all and sundry manufactured commodities from the country,  without being assured  of a  market in foreign countries. Necessarily,  the  Government  can  only embark  upon  an  export  policy  in  relation  to  these products,  for  which  there  is  an  easy  and  readily available market abroad. For  this  reason also,  sugar produced by the vacuum pan  process  may  have  been selected,  because  such  sugar  is  perhaps  in  demand abroad and not.sugar produced by any  other  process. It must be  realised  that  goods  manufactured  in  our country have to stand heavy competition  from  goods produced abroad, and  even  this  export  can  only  be made  at  great  sacrifice,  and  is  made  only  to  earn foreign  exchange,  which  would  not,  otherwise,  be available. In this view  of the  matter,  it  cannot be  said  that there is  discrimination in so  far as sugar manufacturers by the vacuum  pan  process  are  concerned. Govern ment is the  best  judge  as  to  which  commodities are most likely to earn foreign  exchange, and the selection thus made is  justifiable  as  a  reasonable  classification ct,  name y,  t  e The  petitioners contend that the whole export  programme  in  respect of sugar amounts  to  an  infringement  of  their  fund amental  rights  under  Arts. 19(1)  (f)  and  (g),  and amounts also to a  compulsory acquisition of their pro perty  without  payment  of  compensation. They state  that  the  owners  stand  to  lose,  because, admittedly, sugar is going  to  be  exported  at  a  loss, and the loss is to fall on the owners of factories. It is  urged  that  the Act  is  an  unreasonable  restriction  upon  the  fund amental rights to  hold,  acquire,  and dispose  of  pro perty and to carry on occupation, trade or business. In particular,  referenee is  made  to  the  Sugar (Control)  Order,  1955,  Notification  No. per  maund  in the price of sugar  for  internal  consumption  and  the export quota  was  fixed  at  2i per  cent. The loss,  it  was and Anoth., expected, would be  more  than  set  off  by  the  excess  Hidayatullah J. price which the producers  would  be  able  to  get  for every 20  maunds  sold  for  internal  consumption. It is also pointed out that Government at  that  time  did not wish  to  take  over  the  work  of  export  on  itself and specified as the export agency,  the  Indian  Sugar Mills  Association,  a body composed  of 95  per  cent. The learned Attorney- General also  points  out  that  more  than 95  per cent. of the mills  have stood by this  arrangement,  and  did either supply their  quota  of  sugar  or  sold  it  in  the internal  market  and  made  available  the money for purchase of sugar for export. laid  down  that  in  judging  the  resonableness  of  a restriction  upon fundamental rights,  the  surrounding circumstances  can  be  looked  into. \"  It is important in this context to  bear  in  mind that the  test  of  reasonableness,  wherever  prescribed, should be applied to each individual statute impugned, and no abstract standard, or general pattern of reason- ableness  can be  laid  down as applicable  to  all  cases. See  also  Aruna cha'la  Nadar v.  State of Madras('). It is,  however,  contended that though one  can  look at the  surrounding  circumstances,  .it  is  not  open  to the Court to examine other laws on the subject, unless those  laws  be  incorporated  by  reference. The  existence of such  other  law  is  not  difficult  to establish. The Courts  can take judicial notice of it. As was laid down by the Privy Council in Attorney-General \"any  public  general  knowledge  of  which  the Court would take  judicial notice,  and may in a  proper . No doubt, this  was laid down in a  case  falling within ss. That other  oontemporaneous  legislation  passed  as part of a  legislative plan can be ex11-mined  was  clearly laid  down  by  the  Privy  Council  in  Pillai  v.  Muda In  that  case,  the  question  was  whether nayake ('). During the  course of '959 arguments, their Lordships'  attention  was drawn to a. Th  L  d K  . \"  It was  argued  that  sections  4  and  5  of  the Citizenship  Act  made  it impossible  that  the  descen dants,  however remote,  of a  person who was unable to attain citizenship himself. could ever be able to attain citizenship in Ceylon no matter how  long they resided there, but their Lordships'  attention was subsequently drawn to the Indian and Pakistani Residents (Citizen .ship) Act,  No. It  was  suggested on behalf of tho  appellant that this  Act  might  itself be  ultra vires  as  conferring  a  privilege  upon  Indian Tamils within  s.  29(2)(c)  of the  Constitution  Order-in Council,  and  that  i herefore  it  was  inadmissible  to rebut the inference  that the legislature  had  intended by the Citizenship and Franchise Acts to make Indian Tamils  liable  to  dis>il>ilities  within  the  meaning  of s.  29(2)(b),  but  their  Lordships  cannot  accept  this argument. If there  was a  legislative  plan  the plan must be looked at as a  whole,  and  when so  looked at it is  evident,  in  their  Lordships'  opinion,  that  the legislature  did  not  intend to  prevent  Indian Ta.mils from  attaining  citizenship  provided  that  they  were sufficiently connected with the island. \" For  that  purpose ' export quota  was  xe  at quantity  produced  by a  factory,  the  loss which  was  Hidayatullah J. expected to be Rs. 10 per maund was spread  over the remaining  sugar to be  sold  in  the  country and  was recouped  at 50 nP. Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners contend that by  fixing  a  ceiling  there is no guarantee that the commodity  will  be  sold  at  the  ceiling  price and not at a lower rate. It is  a  well-known  proposi- tion that when commodities  are controlled by fixation of price, the  commodities sell  only  at  the  controlled price and not less. To prevent  any  loss  to  the  petitioners,  countervailing additional prices were  allowed  on  sales  of  sugar  for internal consumption. The  petitioners did not stand to lose ultimately. of their total  production,  and it is inconceivable  that they are unable to sell sugar in the open home market. This suggestion of the petitioners that they are unable to  sell  sugar  at  the  controlled  price  has  not  been substantiated by the  production of  a  single document to show what they  held  in stock and  what  they had sold. Mills shows that they were able  to sell  more than a  lakh of bags in eight months, as against  the quantity of 4,079 bags for export. andAnother contention that they did not have  the requisite grade. Thereafter they asked for supply in instal- Hidayatullah  J.  ments,  and  when  instalments  were  fixed,  they  put forth  the  excuse  of there  being no  wagons  available. They next urged  that the Bank  was charging interest, and that interest  should  be  waived  before the  docu ments would be retired. When  interest  was  waived, In  these the  petition  iu  this  CouJ.lt. they  filed circumstances, in our opinion,  there can be no ground for  holding that there has been an infringement of the fund,imental  rights of the petitioners. There  is  oue  more  circumstance  which  may  be considerecl. It also  stabilised  national economy by  earning  foreign  exchange. Section 6 makes it incumbent  on the  owner to supply that! sugar on  demand and further provides  that after  Th  L  d K  . deli~ery of sugar, the owner retains no rig~t exc~pt ~o su;a,0~;11;:_,;;: receive  payment  therefor  under  s.  9. It must  not  be  forgotten  that during the time payment was due,  the owners were getting an additional  50 nP. on every maund sold by them in the country. Deferred payment is not deprivation of  property,  nor  an  en- croachment upon fundamental  rights. foreign exchange,  and  that  the  exporters  have  been  paid except for  a small balance. We heard consi derable argument  as  to  whether  the  section  would apply to a  case where no delivery was at all  made,  in view of the words : \"where  sugar  delivered by any owner falls  short No  action  has  yet been taken against the Mills under the section ;  nor has any penalty  been  imposed. Whether the petitioners have exposed themselves to any penalty  can  only  be considered when  penalty is  actually imposed on  them. Out of the 50,000 tons, about half was sold in India, and with the sale-proceeds other sugar was bought and exported, and this would not  be  possible  if  the  export  agency were  required to make a  spot cash payment. Necessary deductions  of  expenses  have  to  be  made,  and  the proceeds are then distributed. No doubt, such payment is likely to be  somewhat  delayed  but  looking  to  the small quantity involved (i.e.  not more than 20 per cent. under the Act and in actuality, only 2i  per cent.) for every maund of sugar sold in  India. In  our opinion,  none  of  the  sections  considered  here,  even viewed separately, is ultra vires. No argument can be considered in view of the  want  of a plea to this effect in the two petitions. \u00b7However, in view  of the fact  that learned counsel reserved this point to be raised  for  exemption from  payment  of  additional  duty,  we  say  nothing about it. Some  of  the  petitioners  are  owners  of  factories manufacturing sugar by a  process  called  the  vacuum pan process and they carry  on  business  as  manufac turers of and  dealers  in  sugar. On June 27,  1958, the Government had promulgated an  Ordinance. As  appears from  its preamble, the Act was  intended to  provide for the export  of  sugar  in  public  interest and it set up a  machinery  for  that  purpose. period,  but  the  quantity  so  fixed  for a  year is not to The Umon  of  India exceed  twenty  per  cent. The quantity so  apportioned to each  factory  is  called  its export quot:t.  Section 6  provides that every owner of a  factory  shall,  on  demand  by  the  export  agency deliver to it sugar upto its export quota and on delivery \" the owner shall retain no  rights  in  respect  of  such sugar except  his  right  to  receive  payment  therefor under  section 9.\" Section  7  makes provision for  an additional excise  duty being levied in  certain  circum stances on the  quantity of sugar by  which  the  sugar delivered by  the owner of a  factory falls  short  of  its export quota. Section 8  states that the export agency shall export the sugar delivered to it, provided that  in certain circumstances specified, the export agency may sell that sugar in India and may if  it  thinks  fit  pur- \u00b7 chase other sugar for export and for this purpose permit the owner to sell the whole or part of its export  .quota at a  price approved, on condition t.hat the sale proceeds are paid to it. The provisions of  s.  9  are  important and will be set out later. By  a notification dated June 27,  1958,  50,000  tons of  sugar rt is unnecessary to  refer to theRe  reasons for  if  thn  Act is invalid, as 'the  petitioners  contend  the  orders  could not be made and no question would arise as to whether the petitioners had valid reasons for not carrying them out. I  now  proceed to examine the ,-alidity of this contention. Section  9.-(l)  The  export  agency  shall,  at  such time  as it  thinks fit,  make  to  the  owners who  have delivered sugar to  it under  this Act,  payments  deter- T '\u00b7 L  dK. He  has  no  hand in deciding at what price the goods  would  he  sold  by the export  agency. If they  are  sold for  a  very  low p;ice, he  has no right to complain. Neither has he any power  to control  the  expenses. It may he difficult to say that all these terms are reasonable. However that may be,  there is  another aspect of the question  which  in my view decides it. It is quite plain that as things are, sugar can be sold abroad  only  at a loss. The export  of sugar, however,  involves  a  loss,  even if  excise  duty and cane cess are remitted.\" In paragraph 22  of Shri  Jain's  said  affidavit  it  is d th urt  er Ray t  at...  e en  ire sc  eme envisage in the  Act  depends  on  the  pooling  of  the  losses  on export by all sugar factories in India,  in proportion  to their export  quota.'' It is  said that  the Act was passed with a  view to earn  foreign  exchange by  export  of  sugar. earning of foreign exchange is essential for the country. It is  not as  if  foreign  exchange  could not  be earned without inflicting loss on the  manufacturers  of sugar. A reasonable restriction on a  citizen's  right  to carry  on his trade which alone is  permitted by Art. 19(6)  of the Constitution, must be, as Mahajan, J., said in Chintaman Rao v.  The  State  of  Jl;Jadhya  Pradesh(1 ),  a  restriction \"which reason dictates\",  which  \"unlei;s  it  strikes  a proper  balance  between  the  freedom  guaranteed  in article 19(1) (g)  and  the  social  control  permitted  by clause (6)  of article 19,  must be held to be  wanting  in that quality.\" I  also think it clear that an object however laudable, cannot by itself and without more, make  a  restriction The Lord Krishna S\u00abgar Mills Ltd ..  put on a  citizen's right to carry on a  trade  for  attain- ing that.object,  reasonable. A  restriction  on  a  per- son's  right  to  carry  on  his  trade  does  not  become The  Unio11  of Indio reasonable,  simply  because  it  had  been  imposed  on him  to achieve an object  of  great  necessity  and  un . This, in  my view, is too  clear to require elaboration. On the contrary, these affidavits make it perfectly  plain  that in the foreseeable  future there is no  hope  of export  of Indeed,  it  is  said in sugar  being  made  at  a  profit. There is no  bn,is whntcver for snying that in some years  the export may result in a  profit. Indeed  on  the  respon dents'  own  affidavits  it is  not  open  to  them  to  say that they hope that it  may  be  possible  in  future  to make a  profit oil  export of sugar. Then  it  is  said  that  the  export  quota. I for myself would hesitate to  say  that losses in such amounts are negligible. The export quota for 1958-59 has been  fixed  at 5  }Jer  cent. Does reason dictate that a  small loss shall be inflicted? Order,  1955,  they  gave adjustment in  price by adding 50 nP. per nrnuud  in  the ex-factory prices of sugar  for that they had not  been  able  to  Hell  the  sugar  in  the home  m,trket at t,hc  incre\u2022tsed price.

It was not indeed  it  had intended  to  ont\u00b7n  foreign  exchange; nothing to do with foreign  exchange  or  with  helping the sugar industry.

It is said that this is so ;  that in judging the reason ableness  of  the restriction  imposed  by one Act,  it  is permissible  to  consider an order made by the executive Government under another  Act. I  respectfully agree  with all  that  the  learned  Chief Justice sairl, but  1 am  unable to see that this advances . is  sought  a.lso  from  a.noth0r  observation  of the  learnPd  Chi<'f  .Tnstice  at  t.\\w  snme  pagP  which 1 lrn ve not  quotPd,  to  the effect  t !mt. reasonableness  has to be decided  in  all  the circumstances of a  givPn  case.

But I  am wholly unable to see that the conditions  or  circumstances,  which  seem  to me to mean the same  t  m_g,  can  .me u. e  t  at  w  IC depends  solely  on the arbitrary discretion or generos- ity or the sense of fair play of another. That  is  not  a  reasonable The  Union  of India test. It is  not reasonable to say that the validity of a statute would depend  on something which the execut ive Government may do  or  undo at  any  time. How can such a  re striction  be  reasonable? How  can  an  Act  which  is prima facie  unreasonable-and it  is  on that basis that the present argument arises-be held  to be reasonable because of something to which  it  gives  no  right  and the existence of which  depends entirely on  the  choice of the executive Government ? Is it to be said that the restrictions  imposed  by  a  statute  are  reasonable because the Government has,  when the question crop ped up, done something which makes  the  restrictions reasonable  though  it  was  not  bound  to do that and though it is  free  to undo that which it has  done ? Furthermore,  if  the  respondents'  contention  was right a  statute would then be legal  when  the  Govern ment chooses to do a  thing and illegal when it  undoes it and so on from  time  to  time  at  the  choice of  the Government. That would be  intolerable in any  legal system. It  was said that this is unavoidable and may happen in many cases. Suppose  in  famine  conditions  a  statute  was passed controlling free sale of foodstuff. But further  suppose  that after sometime  the famine  conditions  returned. validity of the Act would then be  restored. Hence,  it is said that there would be nothing unusual in  the Act B  t  \u2022t u . l seems  to  me  that  thIS  IS  no  analogy. If fluctuating validity  is the result in one case, it does not follow  that the same consequence  would  occur  in  another  and  a  totally different case. The  power  to  fix the prir ~ of sugar given thereby can be exercised  \" for maintaining or increasing the supplies of any essential commodity or for  securing their equitable  distribution and availability  at  fair  prices\". That power  cannot therefore be  exercised  for recouping  loss  caused  to  a manufacturer by another Act, the object of which is to earn foreign  exchange. I  find  it  impossible to say that  a Notification fixing the price of sugar on different condi in  deciding  the tions  can  be reasonableness of the impugned  Act  which is  entirely unconnected with  these  considerations. For all these reasons I  am unable to  agree  that  the Notification  increasing  the  home  price  can be  taken It follows  The  Lord  Kmr.na St<gar  Mills  Ltd., th  t  th lC  sugar and Anothtr manufacturers and there is nothing  to show  that  the v. restrictions are even so  reasonable. Then it is said that the Indian ~ugar Mills  Associa- tion of which the petitioners  <1l'e  Raid  to  be  members, wanted that arrangements for  export. It is therefore contend- ed that the restrictions imposed by  the  Act  must  be presumed to be reasonable and the  petitioners cannot be  heard to say that they  are not. Therefore,  it seems to me that the petitioners' rights are not affected by anything which the Associctt.ion  might  have done. And of course it is only the It is true  that  the Act with which we  arc concerned. Association  had suggested that the Government should take  steps  for  export  of sugar.

In this year  a  substantial quantity was exported and large profits could be made . For this  purpose  the  imggestion  made  as  appears  from annexute  \"D\"  to  the  affidavit  of  Shri Jain, was as follows: \"The internal market will be Jen free  as at present. However to  provide  an  element  of  stability  to  the market releases for  internal sale shall  be  regulated  by Government of India in  active  consultation  with  the industry.\" There remains  one  other  contention  to  deal  with. :i A:o;h.,  \u00b7\u00b7  result in stabilising  the  sugar  industry. From what I  have earlier  stated  it  does not appear to me  that the industry needed  any  stabi lisation. The figures given earlier show  that  produc tion  has always  been less  than  internal  eonsumption, excepting for  the year 1951-52. \"Again in  1952-53  it was decided  to  export upto 2 lakh  tons. th11  Y'\"\"  19:38-59  in  tons The  estimated  figures  for appear  to  be  as  follows:  production-\u00b7  19,00,000 con sumption-21,00,000, export-1,00,000. It would thus appear that the  sugar  industry  in  India  has  always been  stable and did not require any export to make  it stable. Under that section,  in fixing the  total  quantity  of  wgar  to  be  exported  in  any season  regard is  to  be  had only to the quantity avail able  in India, the quantity  required  for  consumption in India and the necessity of earning foreign exchange. which  makes the petitioners suffer a  loss  on  the  sale  The  Lord Krishna of a  part of  their  produce  imposes  a  restriction  on  Sugar Mills  Ltd., their right to carry on their business  which  cannot in the circumstances of this case he said to be reasonable an consider  it  necessary  to discuss  the other objections.

It is explained therein that the factories  are  expected to  realise  actually  on their internal sales Rs.

That decision was  concerned with the question whether s.  15(2)(b) of the Indian Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1908 (14 of 1908), as amended by the Indian Criminal Law Amend- ment  (Madras)  Act,  1950,  was  unconstitutional  and void. In discussing the  said  question, Patanjali  Sastri,  C.J., observed at p.  607 : \"  It is important in this context to bear in mind that the test of reasonableness, wherever prescribed, should be applied to each  individual  statute  impugned,  and no abstract standard, or general pattern of reasonl:!oble ness can be laid down as applicable to all  cases. and  forming  their own  conception  of what is  reason- able,  in  n,ll  the  circunrntn,nces  of  n,  given  case,  it  is f )J u  osop iy. vice i8  rampant,  any  restriction imposed to eradicate that Yi<>e  has to be  moulded  in  accordance  with the needs of the time.

But I  am clear in  my mind that\u00b7the validity of an  Act  shall not be made to depend  upon  another  Act  unconnected  with the impugned Act or power  conferred  thereunder,  which .might, if properly exercised,  off.set  the evil tendency or the vice of the  impugned  Act. If the  validity of an Act is made  to depend  upon such a  foundation,  a super-structure will  have been built on  shifting sands. The illustrations are not  exhaustive,  but they all  fall under one or  other  of  the  following  two  categories : (i) an earlier Act is made part of a new Act; and (ii) both Acts are parts of a  legislative  scheme  or  plan  where both of  them  were  conceived  at  the  inception  but passed in stages, or conceived at different times on the basis of experience gained  but  passed  in  furtherance the  test  of of  the  same  scheme. reasonableness in regard to  one  Act  may  be  made to depend upon the impact of the other on it. To go  further and  to  depend  upon  a  notification  of  a  transitory The  Union  of India nature issued  under  an  unconnected  Act  is  to  place the statute in a  fluid  state. In  such  a  situation  its validity  would  depend  . upon  a  statutory  order  of temporary duration;  4t  would change colour  with the changing attitudes of an authority empowered to issue the order. It would also mean that a  Court will  have to  embark  upon  a  roving  search  of  all  Acts  and notifications  which  may,  by  design  or  accident, alleviate  or  mollify  the  evil  consequences  of  an impugned Act. The learned Attorney-General has not placed  before us any decision in support of his broad  propositian;  but When a  statute is attacked on the ground that  it  is  a  colourable  legislation, i.e.,  it assumed  a form  apparently faliing within  the legislative  compet ence  of  the  legislature  but  in  effect  and  substance intended  to  reach  institutions  beyond  its  legislative competence,  it  is  obvious  that  all  the  surrounding circumstances,  including  other  acts operating  in  the Province, have to be scrutinized  to unravel  the  fraud on  power. This  decision,  in  my  view,  cannot  be invoked to serve  the present  purpose. \"  Their  Lordships  do  not  cite  this  report  as evidence of the facts there found,  but as indieating the Act,  1948,  of Ceylon, was questioned  in  tlrnt case.

Indeml the E;;;sential Commodities Act waH enacted to provide in the i11tore:-1t  of the gen<:'ml  publie for  control of production, :rnpply  and  di:;trihution  of, and trade and commerec in, certain commodities.

In  exercise  of  that power,  the  Central  Government  should  not  fix  the quantity of sugar for  export as to exceed in any  year in the aggregate twenty  per cent. Under s.  5, the Central  Government  is  empowered  to  apportion the  quantity  of  sugar  fixed  from  time  to  time  for. purposes of  export  under  s.  4  among  the  owners  in proportion to the quantity of sugar produced, or likely to be  produced,  by them respectively during the season referred  to above. :'-iection  6 enjoins  on the owners of sugar  factories to  deliver  to  the  export  agency, appointed under the Act,  the sugar produced  in their factories  in  such  quiintities,  of  such  grade,  in  such manner, within  such time and iit  such place,  as may be  specified  hy  the  export  agency  in  that  behalf. When such delivery is  made,  the owner ceases  to have any  more  right  over  the  sugar  except  to  receive payment  \u00b7therefor. sale-proceeds,  the total expenditure  incurred  by  the z959 -- export agency in respect of  the sugar exported should d  The  Lord  Krisllna l b  d  d d ld  b e  e  ucte  an e  apport1one tie  a  ance  s  ou ,  M'lt  Ltd h f ., \"~ar  '  s h among t  e  owners  m  proportion  to  t  e  quan  1ty  o and Another sugar delivered by them  for  export  during  the  year. Section 7 deals with a  situation  when the  ~ugar is not delivered, and it reads: \"S. 7(1):  Where  sugar  delivered by  any  owner falls  short  of the  export  quota  fixed  for  it  by  any quantity (hereinafter referred to as  the said quantity), there shall be levied and collected on  so  much  of  the sugar despatched from  the factory for  consumption  in India as is  equal to the said quantity, a  duty  of excise at the rate of seventeen rupees per maund.\" It cannot be,  and  indeed  it  is  not,  denied  that  at  the time the Act was passed there was a sincere and serious national  effort  to  industrialize  our  country  with the avowed object  of  raising  the  economic  standards of our  people. the  necessary  conditions  for industrializing our eountry is to start heavy industries, and that  cannot  be  done  unless  the  country  earn8 foreign  exchange  to  enable  it  to  import  plants  for starting the same. It is  also self-evident that it would be  in  the  interests  of  sugar  industry  to  build  up  a foreign  market for  that commodity. Sugar  Mills  Ltd., t  a  t  e  c  serves  t  e nat10na  m  erest, it is conce  e and  Another I  find  it  not  possible  to  hold  that  the  restrictions v. are unreasonable or excessive. If there was no statutory  compulsion  on  the  owners  of  factories  to d  . e sugar  pro  uce  m supp y  a  reasona  e  ract1on o their factories,  the  export  agency  would  not  get  the requisite  quantity  of  sugar  for  export. If there was no  provision  imposing  a  penal  cess  on  defaulters, there would be no sanction  to compel them  to  deliver their quota of sugar. It is  common case that at present the  export  trade in sugar ends in loss;  but  it  cannot  be  predicated  that  it  will  be a chronic feature and there  will  not come  a  time. when the export trade in sugar will  earn profits. It may be that a  better scheme migl).t  have  been evolved by  the legislature or  it  might  be  more  beneficial  from  the standpoint of owners of factories  if  t.he  State purchas- ed the exportable <1uantity for ready cash  and exported the same on its own  account. But  it  is  not  for  this Court to evaluate the comparative  merits  of  different schemes so  long  it  is  satisfied  that  the  scheme  actu- ally  evolved  stands  the  test  of  reasonabless. The  State  as  well  as  the industry  are  equally  interested  to  stimulate  foreign trade and build up foreign  market. To capture foreign market or to have a  substantive  share  therein  is  not an easy task, as  it depends upon many imponderables, namely,  the  availability  of  sugar,  its  demand,  its comparative ID;erit,s  with the sugar  produced  in  other markets, transport facilities, mutual agreement requift ments, loss must have  to  be borne to  get  a  ~oothold and the clear objective will have to be pursued purposrifully and tena- ciously. 1 d  b S<1gar  Mills Ltd \u2022\u2022  th  A  t e  ene  ma y results  flowing  from  the  Act  are  significant.

I  am,  therefore,  to  request  you  to  kindly  circulate  the  aforesaid  Court\u201fs guidelines  amongst  the  Judicial  Officers  posted  in  your  Judgeship  for  their information and strict compliance. Guidelines  for  sending  Training  Programme  by  Training  institutes and application for exemption, if any, to be sent by Judicial Officers. \u201cAll  the  Judicial  Officers  who  are  nominated  by  the  Hon'ble  Court  for different training programmes are ordinarily required to undergo training as ordered by the Hon'ble Court. All  the  District  Judges  and  judicial  officers  in  judgeship  and  the  officer posted  on  deputation  subordinate  to  the  High  Court  of  Judicature  at Allahabad are informed that if any nominated officer seeks exemption he is to send his exemption application at the earliest preferably  within three days after receipt of Court's nomination letter. duly  issued  by  competent authority in that connection.

I have been directed to say that Hon'ble Court has directed that apart from books  already  provided  by  the  Director  General  (Prosecution),  General  Rules (Criminal) may be provided to the Public Prosecutors by the IJTR, Lucknow. I have also been directed to say that apart from other subject, the training of Public  Prosecutors  about  Effective  Legal  Writing  may  be  taken  up  by  the  IJTR, Lucknow  and the training of Public Prosecutors at IIM, Lucknow be accordingly modified. The High Level Monitoring Committee may take appropriate decision for implementing it. While  enclosing  a  copy  of  Judicial  Officers  Revolving  Fund  Niyamavali- 2012 along with Government\u201fs order dated 17.06.2013 and a copy of Uttar Pradesh Government  Servants  (Medical  Attendance)  Rules,  2011  as  amended  in  2014 concerning the above mentioned subject, I have been directed to apprise you that if any judicial officer-ex-judicial officer including yourself wants to avail facility of medical treatment for himself or his dependents at S.G.P.G.I., he may get himself enrolled  in  S.G.P.G.I. and  obtain  a  Central  Registration  Number,  required  to  be entered  by  head  of  office,  while issuing  him  a  health  card/authority letter/identification  letter,  necessary  for  availing  the  facility  of  treatment  on  a request  made  by  him  by  furnishing all  relevant  information on  prescribed  format given in appendix-\u201eA\u201f under Rule 6(a) of the Uttar Pradesh Government Servants (Medical Attendance) Rules, 2011. Directions  for  keeping  the  closed  files  regarding  a  complaint  against Judicial Officer on his/her personal file maintained under Rule-429 (1) of G.R. has also been found that directions of the Hon\u201fble Court regarding processing of complaints  are  not  being  observed  properly. Administrative  correspondence regarding a complaint against particular officer of the district is not kept in the file of that particular officer, maintained in the administrative office of that judgeship. Even after sufficient directions issued in this regard vide C.L. Dated 23rd March, 1971, no uniform  practice  has  been  found  for  keeping  the  files  of  administrative correspondence regarding complaint. This result into great difficulty in locating all the complaints made against the particular officer in a particular district and leads to corrupt practice. Dated 23rd March, 1971, I am directed to request you  that  directions  contained  therein  shall  strictly  be  adhered  to  and  you  are  to ensure that all closed files regarding a complaint against judicial officer be kept on his/her personal file, maintained under Rule 429 (a) of G.R. All  complaints  against  Judicial  Offices  should  be  referred  to  the  Court  for While forwarding complaints against Judicial Officers to the Court, District Judges should give their comments also and enquire into the complaints and take suitable action in the matter. On  all  complaints  against  an  officers  or  a  member  of  the  staff  sent  for enquiry  and  report,  the  District  Judges  should  send  complete  report. It  should invariably be to the point, thorough and objective. Whenever necessary the record should  also  be  perused  while  sending  the  report  and  corrupt  and  inefficient officers/  officials  should  not  be  shielded. A  clear  opinion  should  always  be expressed  on  the  allegations  made. If  the  allegations  made  are  in  respect  of  a pending  or  it  decided  case  the  opinion  should  be  expressed  in  clear  words  but without  being  too  critical  of  judicial  independence  of  an  officer  has  not  to  be curbed  in  any  way. What  has  to  be  seen  is  whether  the  order  passed  is  or  is  not reasonable  and  also  whether  it  was  passed  after  taking  into  consideration  all  the facts and circumstances of the case. Reiterating  the  marginally  quoted  Circular  Letters  I  am  directed  to  communicate that  no  Judicial  Officer  will  attend  Hon\u201fble  Judges  on  the 1.

I am, therefore, to request you to kindly circulate the aforesaid instructions of  the  Hon\u201fble  Court  to  all  the  Judicial  Officers  working  under  your  supervision and control for strict compliance of the order of Hon\u201fble Court in letter and spirit. and another filed against the judgment and order dated 8.3.2011  passed  by  the  Additional  Sessions  Judge,  Court  No. of the accused who had been acquitted despite the said section having  been  come  into  force  on2.11.2010,  to  ensure  his  appearance  before  the higher  court  as  and  when  such  court  issued  notice  in  respect  of  any  appeal  or petition. court  as  and  when  such  court  issued  notice  in  respect  of  any  appeal  or  petition, filed against the judgment of the respective courts, a direction has been issued for issuing  a  circular  letter  to  all  the  District  and  Sessions  Judges  for  ensuring  strict compliance  of  the  provisions  of  the  above-mentioned  section  by  all  courts  under their administrative control.

I am, therefore, to request you to kindly circulate above mentioned judgment dated 12.09.2012 (copy enclosed herewith) passed in Criminal Appeal No. 2005, Chandrama @ Magram Yadav & Another Vs.

In  continuation  of  Court\u201fs  earlier  Circular  Letter  No. 17  dated  04.07.2014 regarding expeditious disposal of cases in relation to sitting MPs and MLAs who Reiterating  the  directions  of  Court\u201fs  earlier  Circular  Letter  no. 17  dated 04.07.2014,  I  am  further  directed  to  say  that  the  District  Judge  concerned  shall personally monitor to ensure disposing of such cases in no case later than one year from the date of framing of charge(s) under the intimation of this Court. Compliance of the order dated 20.01.2014 passed by Hon\u2018ble Supreme Court in Criminal Appeal No. The court must ensure that it is brought on record.

(iii)  The  statement  of  a  lady  witness,  if  she  wishes,  may  be  recorded  in  the presence  of  a  person  (preferably  a  female)  of  her  wish/choice  so  that  she may feel secured. in  connection  with  recording  evidence  of  a  medical Order  dated  18.10.2010  passed  by  Hon\u2018ble  Supreme  Court  in  Civil  Appeal No. 7/VIIIa-5  Dated 7th August, 1951 directed  to  apprise  you  the  following  directions  in 2. If  the  Doctors  attend  the  Court  for  giving evidence,  their  evidence  may  be  recorded  without delay, ensuring that they are not required to wait.

Frequent summoning  of  a  Medical  Practitioner  and  that  too  at  short notice I  am,  therefore,  directed  to  request  you  to  circulate  a  copy  of  the  instant Circular  Letter  amongst  all  the  Judicial  Officers  working  under  your  supervision and control and to ensure compliance of the same in letter and spirit. (i)  Regular  visit  of  Presiding  Juvenile  Board  Magistrates  from  the  other districts whose children are lodged in the home in another district. I  am  directed  to  say  that  Hon\u201fble  Court  has  resolved  that  the  Magistrates presiding the Juvenile Justice Board of the district where the observation Home is located shall visit Home once in a month and draft an inspection memo, while the Magistrates presiding Juvenile Justice Board of neighbouring districts from where the Juveniles are lodged in Observation Home of other district shall visit officially such Home quarterly to supervise upkeep of the inmates belonging to their districts preferably on a day when the court is not functioning and draft an inspection memo so that he can obtain first hand information of the children belonging to his district in that Juvenile Home and can address their problems, and also make suggestions for the better running of the Home. I have been directed to draw your attention to the use of the provisions under Section  309  and  327  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure,  since  the  general impression has been that even in the trial of accused involved in heinous crimes, these provisions are not being invoked and used, as scrupulously as they should be. Instead, adjournments are being given even in trial of such serious cases at par with other cases as a norm. Therefore your are suggested to adhere to these provisions in trial of cases involving heinous crimes such as rape. This has become imperative as continuing delay in dispensation of justice in such cases, may erode the faith of people in the credibility of criminal justice system. The need of the hour then is to respond by conducting trials without adjournment as far as possible and by bringing culprits to justice in the shortest possible time.

(iv)  Compliance  of  the  directions  given  by  Hon\u2018ble  Court  in  Criminal Appeal  no. and  adopting  correct  procedure  in  initiations  of  proceedings under Section 446 Cr. While  deciding  the  above  noted  Criminal  Appeal  no. the  Hon\u201fble  Court  has  noticed  that  different  practice  is being  followed  in  different  Judgeship  for  putting  number  of  cases  like  Gangster Act, SC & ST Act etc. and also that the Subordinate Courts are not following the correct procedure while initiating th3e proceedings under Section 446 of Cr. PC for recovery of the amount after forfeiture. With above object in mind  the  Hon\u201fble  Court  has  observed  that  there  are  two  types  of  Criminal  cases which  are  to  be  tried  by  the  Sessions  Judge  including  Additional  Sessions  Judge and  Special  Judge. and  these  cases  of  special  category  which  are  not  received  after committal  must  be  numbered  as  criminal  cases  and  which  are  not  received  after committal  must  be  numbered  as  criminal  cases  and  not  the  Sessions  trial. The procedure of Sessions trial and criminal cases is also different. criminal cases while initiating proceedings under Section  446  Cr. Whereas the law and rules provide that  the  proceedings  under  Section  446  Cr.PC  must  be  registered  separately  and separate number must be put to such proceedings. recovery proceedings under Section 446 Cr.PC in the file of Sessions trial without putting separate misc. In  view  of  the  above  observations  of  Hon\u201fble  Court,  I  am  directed  to communicate  that  from  now  onwards  all  the  cases  pertaining  to  special  category such as Gangster/SC& ST Act etc. shall not be registered as Sessions trial rather such cases shall be registered as \u201eSpecial Criminal Cases\u201f so as to distinguish them from such category of cases which are being received after committal and further in drawing proceedings under Section 446 Cr.P.C., every such proceedings shall be registered as a separate misc.

The Magistrate, upon receipt of the information of such complaint, recorded under Section 155 Code of Criminal Procedure, shall proceed, in the meantime, to take appropriate action under Sub-Section (2).

Hon\u201fble  Court  has  also  desired  in  this regard  that  endeavour  should  preferably  be  made  to  decide  these  appeals  by  the District Judge himself. (b) If  the  accused does not  made  an  application  for  compounding  as  aforesaid Let  it  also  be  clarified  that  any  costs  imposed  in  accordance  with  these guidelines should be deposited with the Legal Services Authority operating at the level of the Court before which compounding take place. For instance, in  case  of  compounding  during  the  pendency  of  proceedings  before  a Magistrate\u201fs  Court  or  a  Court  of  Sessions,  such  costs  should  be  deposited with  the  District  Legal  Services  Authority. Likewise,  costs  imposed  in connection  with  composition  before  the  High  Court  should  be  deposited with the State Legal Services Authority and those impose in connection with composition  before  the  Supreme  Court  should  be  deposited  with  the National Legal Services Authority. Therefore,  while  enclosing  herewith  a  copy  of  the  Order  dated  03.05.2010 passed by the Hon\u201fble Apex Court in the above mentioned case you are requested to  kindly  circulate  this  circular  letter  to  all  the  Judicial  Officers  under  you supervision and control for their information and necessary compliance. (viii)  Compliance  of  the  direction  given  by  Hon\u2018ble  High  Court  in  Criminal Misc. I  am  further  directed  to  request  you  to  kindly  circulate  the  aforesaid Judgment/order  of  the  Court  to  all  the  Judicial  Officers  working  under  your supervision and control for their guidance and necessary compliance. While enclosing a copy of the judgment & order dated 22.11.2010 passed by Hon\u201fble  the  Apex  Court  (Hon\u201fble  Mr.  Justice  Markandey  Katju  and  Hon\u201fble Justice  Gyan  Sudha  Misra)  in  Special  Leave  Petition  (Crl.) 9507  of  2010 (entitled Rajbir @ Raju & Another Vs. State of Haryana), I am directed to say that the Hon\u201fble Supreme Court has directed to ordinarily add section 302 I.P.C. So  that  death  sentence  can  be  imposed  in  such heinous and barbaric crimes against women. I  am,  therefore,  to  request  you  to  circulate  the  circular  letter  and  copy  of Judgment/Order  of  Hon\u201fble  the  Supreme  Court  to  all  the  Judicial  Officers  under your administrative control for their information & guidance. (i)  Compliance  of  the  direction  given  by  Hon\u2018ble  Supreme  Court  in  Writ Petition (Civil) No. While  enclosing  herewith  a  copy  of  the  order  dated  01.08.2013  passed  by Hon\u201fble  Supreme  Court  in  Writ  Petition  (Civil)  No. & Ors., I am directed to say that Hon\u201fble Apex Court has expressed deep concern over the plight of women under trial prisoners and that of  their  children  languishing  in  various  jails  with  their  mothers. Hon\u201fble  Apex Court has directed to impress upon all the courts of the country dealing with cases of women prisoners whose children are in prison with their mothers to give priority to such cases and to decide their cases expeditiously. Hon\u201fble Court has directed in this regard that the District & Sessions Judge shall obtain quarterly returns from the Jail Superintendent in regard to number of women  convicts  who  are  lodged  in  jail  either  with  children  or  without  children mentioning the age of the child. The District Judges should ensure that on receipt of  information  necessary  steps  are  taken  for  expeditious  disposal  of  cases  by informing the courts where these cases are pending. Judicial  Officers  working  under  you  supervision  and  control  to  give  priority  to cases  of  women  prisoners  whose  children  are  in  prison  with  their  mother  and  to decide such cases expeditiously. I have been directed to draw your attention to the use of the provisions under Section  309  and  327  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure,  since  the  general impression has been that even in the trial of accused involved in heinous crimes, these provisions are not being invoked and used, as scrupulously as they should be. Instead, adjournments are being given even in trial of such serious cases at par with other cases as a norm. Therefore your are suggested to adhere to these provisions in trial of cases involving heinous crimes such as rape. This has become imperative as continuing delay in dispensation of justice in such cases, may erode the faith of people in the credibility of criminal justice system. The need of the hour then is to respond by conducting trials without adjournment as far as possible and by bringing culprits to justice in the shortest possible time. Chaudhari Vs. State (Delhi) Administration, (1984) 1 SCC 722, I am directed to state that the High Court is noticing disturbing trend  in  criminal  trials,  where  Sessions  cases  are  being 26.07.1990 adjourned,  in  some  cases  to  suit  convenience  of  counsels  or  because  the prosecution or the defence is not fully ready and considers it necessary to draw the attention of all the Sessions Judges and Additional Sessions Judges once again to the provision of Section 309 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and directs Trial  Judges  are  reminded  of  the  need  to  comply  with  Section  309  of  the Code in letter and spirit. No  adjournment  shall  be  granted  at  the  request  of  a  party,  except (5)  Adjournment  or  postponement  can  only  be  made,  in  a  proper  case,  on payment  of  sufficient  costs  on  the  party  seeking  the  adjournment. When examination of witnesses h as begun and the witnesses are in attendance, the trial may  be  adjourned  without  examining  the  witnesses  only  for  special  reasons  (i.e. for exceptional and not ordinary reasons) to be recorded in writing. Vs. Shambhu Nath Singh and others, reported in 2001 (4) SCC 667; Raj Deo Sharma Vs. State of Bihar,  1999Cr.L.J. Sessions cases should be disposed of within one year of their institution, the (7) date of commitment being taken as the date of institution Cases pending for longer periods should be regarded as old cases in respect of which explanations should be furnished in the calendar statements and in the periodical returns. (8) Sessions cases should be given precedence over all other work and no other work should be taken up on session\u201fs days until the sessions work for the day is completed. If for any reason, a case has to be adjourned or postponed, intimation should be given forthwith to both sides and immediate steps be taken to stop the witnesses and to secure their presence on the adjourned date. (9)  On receipt of the order of commitment the case should be posted for trial to as  early  a  date  as  possible,  sufficient  time,  say  three  weeks,  being  allowed  for securing the witnesses. Sufficient time should be allowed for each case so that one case  does  not  telescope  into  the  next. Every  endeavour  should  be  made  to  avoid telescoping and for this, if necessary, the court should commence sitting earlier and continue sitting later than the normal hours. I am, therefore, to request you to kindly circulate the aforesaid instructions of the Hon\u201fble Court to all the judicial officers working under your supervision and control  for  strict  compliance  for  ensuring  he  expeditious  disposal  of  Sessions cases.

No Special Judge under any Act is empowered to try an offence which is shown triable by the court of sessions as per  the  schedule  of  the  Cr.P.C.,  however  it  is  true  that  the  special  court  so constituted  under  an  Special  Act  may  have  to  be  manned  by  either  a  Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge. Therefore the Hon\u201fble Court has directed that the officers be instructed not to describe their courts by names which creates confusion  or  which  does  not  really  reflect  their  constitution  as  per  Cr.P.C. Therefore, enclosing herewith a copy of the said judgment and order, I am to request  you  to  kindly  circulate  a  copy  of  the  same  among  all  the offices of  your judgeship for strict compliance of the same.

Hon\u201fble  Court  has  noticed  that  on  several  occasions  claim  petitions  under Motor Vehicles Act arising out of same accident are tried and decided by different courts separately resulting in conflicting findings/decisions. In  order  to  avoid  such  conflicting  findings  and  decisions,  it  is  directed  by Hon\u201fble  Court  that  all  claim  petitions  arising  from  the  same  accident  should  be clubbed and tried together by the same court, as for as possible, may be by separate judgments. I am, therefore, to request you to kindly circulate the aforesaid directions to all the Judicial Offices including Judges presiding over the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal,  working  under  your  supervision  and  control  for  their  information  and necessary compliance.

State  of  Maharashtra  has observed that the  right to  access  to legal aid, to  consult  and to  be  defended by  a legal practitioner,  arises  when  a person, arrested  in  connection  with  a cognizable offence, is first produced before a magistrate. Hon\u201fble Supreme Court accordingly, holds  that  it  is  the  duty  and  obligation  of  the  magistrate  before  whom  a  person accused  of  committing  a  cognizable  offence  is  first  produced  to  make  him  fully aware that it is his right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner and, in case he has no means to engage a lawyer of his choice, that one would be provided to him from legal aid at the expense of the State. This is the right that flows from Articles 21 and 22(1) of the Constitution of India and needs to be strictly enforced.

Advocates  Welfare  Fund  Act,  1974  (as amended)  as  well  as  the  directions  contained  in  the  marginally  noted  Circular Letters issued by the Hon\u201fble Court time to time in this regard. mi;qZDr  fo\"k;d  'kklu  ds  i=  la[;k&1248@lkr&U;k;&7&99&127@90Vh0lh0]  fnukad  30 uoEcj]  1998]  i=  la0&288@lkr&U;k;&7&99&127@90]  fnukad  18  fnlEcj]  1999]  i= la0&611@lkr&U;k;&7&2001&8@2001]fnukad  20  vizSy]  2001]  i=  la[;k&2316@lkr&U;k;&7& 2001&9@2001]  fnukad  30&07&2002]  i=  la[;k&1184@lkr&U;k;&7@2002]  fnukad  10&2002  ,oa i=  la[;k&;w0vks0  19@lkr&U;k;&7&98&155@90Vh0lh0]  fnukad  10  Qjojh]  2005  dh  vksj  vkidk /;ku  vkd`\"V  djrs  gq,  eq>s  ;g  dgus  dk  funs'k  gqvk  gS  fd  mRrj  izns'k  vf/koDrk  dY;k.k  fuf/k vf/kfu;e]  1974  \u00bc;Fkk  la'kksf/kr\u00bd  dh  /kkjk&9\u00bc1\u00bd  }kjk  lHkh  U;k;ky;ksa]  vfHkdj.kksa]  izkf/kdkfj;ksa  ,oa O;fDr;ksa  ds  le{k  nkf[ky  gksus  okys  oknksa  esa  vf/koDrkvksa  }kjk  yxk;s  tk  jgs  odkyrukeksa  ij  :0 10@& ds vf/koDrk dY;k.k fuf/k LVSEi yxkuk vfuok;Z dj fn;k tk;sA bu LVSEiksa dh fcdzh vf/kfu;e dh  O;oLFkk  ds  vuqlkj  uksMy  dks\"kkxkjksa  ds  ek/;e  ls  dh  tkrh  gS  rFkk  bldk  eqnz.k  dydRrk flD;ksfjVh fizUVlZ fy0] dkuiqj ls djk;k tkrk gSA buds forj.k dh O;oLFkk Hkh  eqnzd }kjk  djk;h tkrh gS rFkk budh vkiwfrZ uksMy vf/kdkfj;ksa ds ek/;e ls lqfuf'pr dh tkrh gSA 'kklu ds laKku ea ;g rF; yk;k x;k gS fd vf/koDrk dY;k.kdkjh fVdV izR;sd U;k;ky;ksa esa fu;ekuqlkj yxk;k ugha tk jgk gS] ftlds U;klh lfefr dks okLrfod :i ls ftruh vk; izkIr gksuh pkfg,] og ugha gks ik jgh gSA vr,o bl  laca/k esa  vkidk /;ku mRrj izns'k vf/koDrk dY;k.k fuf/k vf/kfu;e] 1974 \u00bc;Fkk 2& la'kksf/kr\u00bd  dh  /kkjk  9  dh  mi/kkjk  \u00bc1\u00bd  dh  vksj  vkd`\"V  djrs  gq,  vkils  vuqjks/k  gS  fd  d`i;k  mDr micU/k dk vuqikyu lqfuf'pr djus ds fy, d`i;k lHkh lacaf/kr dks vko';d funsZ'k fuxZr djus dk d\"V djsa ,oa fuxZr funsZ'kksa dh ,d izfr 'kklu dks Hkh miyC/k djkus dk d\"V djsaA I have been directed to say that the Hon\u201fbel Court has been pleased to lay down  following  guidelines  for  all  future  constructions  of  Lawyers\u201f  Chambers, Court  Building  or  the  like  from  M.L.A./M.L.C./M.P.

But in  construing the provisions of  s.  r2 of  the Industrial Disputes (Appellate Tribunal) Act  r950, if there was anything in the Companies Act,  r956,  with particular reference to  s.  457  which  was  inconsistent with  the  provisions of Industrial Disputes (Appellate Tribunal) Act  r950, the latter Act shall  prevail. Section  457  of  the  Companies  Act  r956,  concerns a  very special case, it only lays down a condition  precedent  to the  filing of a  case if it has to be  by  the  liquidator  of  a  company  in  the process of  winding up. Section 12 of  the  Industrial  Disputes  (Appellate  Tribunal) Act  r950 is  the  usual statutory provision  which permits an appeal to be  presented to  the Appellate Tribunal,  which otherwise would not  lie,  by any  party who is  aggrieved.

The Court, by its  order  dated  September 8,  1954,  directed  the Liquidators to pay within a  week the arrears of salary of all  the  workmen,  and  also  within  a  week  from receiving sale proceeds of the auction-sale aforesaid, to pay the workers, in lieu of notice,  one week's wages to weekly paid workmen, two weeks'  wages to fortnightly paid workmen, and one month's wages to monthly paid workmen. said,  contended that as  an  auction-purchaser,  he  was Thefr Emptnyccs  not in any event liable  for  any  compensation  or does, as c anne y  t  e wor rn1en;  t,hat  e was not  ound to reinstate  the  old  employees  of  the  Company;  that having purchased the business free  from  any  encum brances,  he  was not Ii a hie for the dues  of the workmen, as  claimed ;  that he  \"  had unnecessarily  been  made a party  and  dragged  here  before  the  Tribunal.\" He added that he admitted that ho was one of the Manag ing Directors of  the  Company  before  its  liquidation, but with the order for liquidation, he  ceased  to  func tion as such. further direetcd that so  far  as  the  Liquida tors were concPrnt>d,  t,he  compensation awarded to the workmen  '' shall be recoverable only out  of the assets in  their  hands  according  to  law ;'.

After  Their Employees such termination of employment, the auction purchaser obtained possession on 24th  July,11954. At that time no  relationship of employer  and  employees  subsisted. Apart from  that, when the auction-purchaser  purchased  the  business  free  from encumbrances  and  all  outgoings  and  liabilities  and when there is nothing to show that  the  auction-pur- chaser undertook at any time to maintain the old staff in his  service,  it  cannot  be  said  that  his  refusal  to continue the employment  of  142  employees  was  un- justified. Only  when one purchases with all assets and liabilities as a  going concern,  he is  bound  to  continue the old employees in service and not otherwise. Against the said Award which, in terms,  was  made only  against  the  Liquidators  and  not  against  the auction-purchaser aforesaid, only one of the two Liqui dators, namely, Debendra Lall Dutt, made an applica tion to the High Court for necessary directions regard ing preferring an appeal.

The provi;;ions  of this  Act  and of  the  rnlei:i and ordcn;  made thereunder shall have effect  notwith standing  anythillg  iuconsidt.ent  therewith  eouta.ined in '1.ny  other law  for  the time being ia force  or  in any instrument having effect  by virtue  of any such law.\" this  Act  against  any award or  decision  of  an  industrial  tribunal  may be presented to the Appellate Tribunal hy- (i)  any party  which  is  aggrieved by the  award or (ii)  the  appropriate  Government  or  the  Central Government, where  it is not  the appropriate  Govern- Greawt Inkd\u2022aLn  d  ment, whether or  not such  Government is  a  party  to otor and Another . \\Ve h>t ve first  to  determine whether  there is  anything in the Indian Companies Aet,  with particular reference to  s.  179  of  the  Indian  Companies  Act,  1913,  (re enacted as s.  457 of the Companies  Act,  1956),  that  is inconsistent  with  the  provisions  of  the  Industrial Disputes (Appellate Tribunal) Act,  1950 (which herein after will  be  referred to  as  \"the Act\"). Hence,  we  have  to construe the  provi sions  of  s.  12  which  specifically  deals  with appeals. That section  permits an appeal to be  presented to  the Appellate Tribunal by r,ny  party which is aggrieved by the a ward  (omitting  the words  not  necessary  for  our present purpose). It is the usual  statutory  provision for an  appeal, which  otherwise would not lie. It  does not say either in ex press terms or by  necessary  impli cation,  that those specific provisions of the Companies Act,  are abrogated or modified. Thus, there is  no inconsistency  between  the aforesaid  provi sions  of the  Act and  the  Companies  Act,  which  only laid  down  a  condition  precedent  to  the  filing of  an appeal, if it has to be,  by a  Liquidator  of a  company in  the  process  of  winding  up. It  concerns  a  very special case and has no bearing on the general right of appeal. un  y  as t  e ere  itor  or contri- Motor  Works Ltd., He  was  impleaded, as already ir-iicated as a  party to the Reference in his  capacity as  ;,fie  auction-purchaser of the business of the Company. So far as that capacity is concerned, it is  clear from the order of the Tribunal, that no  award  was  made  against  him  as  such. He could  not,  therefore,  be  said to  be a  party  aggrieved by the  award, having been exonerated from its terms. In  view  of these  facts, it must be  held that so  far as the  auction-purchaser  is concerned,  he  was  not aggrieved  by the Award made by the Industrial Tribunal. It  is  a  little  difficult to  appreciate why  the  auction purchaser, having succeeded in obtaining the order, set out above, in his favour,  changed his mind and prefer red an appeal which, in the events that had happened, was not maintainable.

        "summary": "Industrial Dispute-Puja  Bonus-Implied  agreement-Tes/ Benefits arising out of service with employer's predecessors-Worlmten if entitled to. Ispahani Ltd.,  which shortly before  the  partition  of  India  transferred its registered  office  from  CO:Icutta  to  Chittagong. Puja  was a special festival in  Bengal and it had  become  usual  with many  firms  there  to  give  bonus before Puja to their workmen. An implied agreement could be inferred if  the following circumstances were established:- (iii)  that it was not paid out of  bounty. that  the  workmen were  not entitled to  any benefits arising out of  their employment with M/s. B. Dadachanji,  S. N.  Andley and  Rameshwar Nath,  Advocate  of  Mfs. WANCHOO  J.-These  are two  connected appeals  by special  leave  against the  Labour Appellate Tribunal in  an  industrial  matter. 473 is by Messrs.  Ispahani Ltd. (hereinafter  called the company) and appeal No. They  will be disposed of by one judgment. There were a  number of  matters which had to  be adjudicated upon ;  but of  these  only two now survive, namely- M. Ispahani Ltd. A  few  facts  may be set out  here  to  give  the back ground of this dispute. Originally,  there was  another company called Messrs. M. M.  Ispahani Ltd.  which was carrying on business in Calcutta since  December  1934 before the partition of India. Shortly before  the parti tion  took  place,  Messrs.  M.  M.  Ispahani  Ltd.  trans ferred  their  registered  head  office  from  Calcutta  to Chittagong,  now  in  Pakistan. That  company  thus It, became  a  Pakistani  company after August 1947. however,  continued  to  own  properties  in  India  and carried on some business in Calcutta on a  small  scale. As  no  bonus  was  paid  in 1953, a  dispute arose between the company and the  workmen,  which was referred for adjudication along with other matters. The  Industrial  Tribunal  held  that  it had not been established  that  puja  bonus  had  been  paid  at  the uniform  rate  of  one  month's  wages for  a  sufficiently long  time  and  for  unbroken  period,  and  therefore rejected  the  claim for  puja  bouns  for  1953. Two  points have been urged in this behalf, namely- Employm  Umon  it was a  finding  of fact ;  and Puja is  a  special festival in Bengal and it has become usual with many firms  there to give bonus before  puja to  their  workmen. 'his right was not based on  the general princi Puja. ple that labour  and  capital  should  share  the  surplus profits  available  after  meeting prior charges. The following  cireumstances  were  laid  down  in  that case  as material for  inferring an implied agreement:- (1)  The payment must be  unbroken: (2)  lt must be  for  a  sufficiently loug period;  and (3)  The  circumstances  in  which  payment  was made should be  such as  tu  oxdude that it was paid out of bounty. The Appellate Tribunal further  pointed out that it was not possible to lay clown  in  tcrnrn  wlmt should  be  the length  of  period  to  justify  the  inference  of  implie<l agreement and that that would depend  upon  the  cir cumstances of each  case. It also  pointed  out that the fact  of payment in a  year of loss  would  he  an  impor tant  factor in  excluding  the  hypothesis  that  the payment  was  out  of  bounty  and  in  coming to  the conclusion  that it was as a  matter of obligation based The claim  for  puja  bonus  in Bengal is based on either  of two grounds. It may  either  be  a  matter  of  implied agreement between employers and employees  creating a  term  of employment for  payment of puja bonus, or (secondly) even though no  implied  agreement  can  be inferred it may be payable as a  customary  bonus. We are of opinion that the  tests laid  down  in that case for inferring that there was an .implied  agreement  for  grant  of  such  a  bonus  are correct  and  it  is  necessary  that  they  should all be satisfied  before bonus of this type can be  granted. established  or  whether  adverse  possession  has  been Proved,  or whether  a  Hindu  family  has  ceased to  be joint as  a  matter  of law  accepting  the facts  proved. The Appellate Tribunal will therefore have jurisdiction to  consider  whether  on  the  facts  proved before  the Employees'  Union  Industrial Tribunal an inference  in law  can be  drawn that  an  implied  term  of  employment  for  grant  of puja  bonus  has  been  established. The  Appellate Tribunal  therefore  had  jurisdiction  to  consider  this matter. Ispahani Ltd. always used to  get puja bonus at the  rate  of  one month's wages. This was asserted by the workmen in their written statement and the company did not deny it in its reply. This aver ment impliedly  admitted  that Messrs.  M. M.  Ispahani Ltd. used to pay puja  bonus as alleged by the  respon dents. lspahani Ltd.  and it was found that it had been paying  bonus ever  since it came into exis tence from  1948 right up to  1952  without  any  break attherate of one month's wages and that this bonus was paid even in the years in  which  the  company  suffered In the circumstances,  it was established in  this loss. The only other question that remains is whether it had been paid for  a  sufficiently  long  period in order  to  justify  the inference that it was an  implied term  of employment. But, as  pointed  out  by  the  Appellate  Tribunal,  when Messrs.  M.  M.  Ispahani  Ltd.  transferred  their  head office  from  Calcutta to Chittagong,  the question  arose of retrenching those  employees who  were  not  willing to go  to Chittagong  in view of  the expected  partition In these circumstances, the company, when of India. it came  into  existence  in  September  1947,  agreed  to employ those employees of Messrs. M.  M. Ispahani Ltd., whose  services  were  likely  to be  terminated. These employees  apparently  agreed  to  the  termination  of their  services  with  Messrs.  M.  M.  Ispahani Ltd.,  and therefore  obtained  settlement  of  their  claims  for provident fund,  and also  received all arrears of  salary from  them. They  were  thereafter  appointed,  after withdrawal of their provident  fund,  by the  company. We  therefore  dismiss  both  the appeals  and  in  con sequence  order  the  parties  to bear their own costs  of this Court.",

        "summary": "The manager held an enquiry and  dismissed Das  from service  for gross misconduct. Das  replied  that  he  would  not put  any questions to them. Thereupon these  witnesses  were  asked  whether the evid ence  they had given  before the manager  was correct,  and  if  not, they were  at liberty to amend it,  to  which  they  replied that the evidence  they had given was correct. Appeal  by  special  leave  from  the  judgment  and order dated October 23,  1956,  of the  Industrial  Tribu nal, Assam in Reference No. The case relates to the dismissal of one  workman  namely, B.  N.  Das  (hereinafter called  Das),  which  had  been taken up  by the Assam  Chah Karmchari Sangh, which is a  registered trade union. A reference  was  made by the Government  of  Assam  on  March 8,  1956,  to the Industrial Tribunal on the  question  whether  the  dis- missal of Das  was  justified;  and  if  not,  whether  he was entitled to  reinstatement  with  or  without  com- pensation or any other relief in lieu thereof. Das  was dismissed  by  the  company  on  March 12,  1955. which amounted to gross misconduct under the Stand- ing Orders. The case was reported to the  police  and Phulbari Tea  Estate Das as well as Samson  were  arrested. Das remained in  jail up to February 25,  1955, when he  was  released on bail. Thereafter,  he  was  served  with  a  charge-sheet  on March 10,  1955,  asking  him  to  show  cause  why  he should not be dismissed for gross  misconduct  as  men tioned above. We shall mention later in detail what happened at the enquiry, as that is the main point which requires consideration  in  this  appeal. Thereafter, his case was taken  up  by  the  union  and eventually  reference  was  made  to  the  Tribunal  on March 8,  1956. It went  on to say that  normally  Das  would  have  been  entitled  to reinstatement but in the peculiar circumstances of this case it was of opinion that  he  should  be  granted  the alternative relief  for  compensation. Consequently, it ordered  that  Das  would  be  entitled  to  his  pay  and allowances from February 28,  to  March 11,  1955  and full pay and allowances from March 12, till the date of payment. It also  ordered that  he  would  be  entitled to fifteen day's pay for  every completed year of service along with all benefits that accrued to him till the date of final  payment. Thereupon,  there  was  an  application  to this  Court  for  special  leave  to  appeal,  which  was granted;  and  that  is  how  the  matter  has  come  up before us. Two points have been urged  before us  on  behalf  of Ph  lb l r1  una under s.  7 of the  Industrial  Disputes  Act, No. Reference in this case was made on  March  8,  1956, before the amending  Act  No. The  contention is that Shri Hazarika who wa.s  the  tribunal  in this case, was not qualified under  this  provision. This conten tion was not raised before the  Tribunal  and  therefore the facts necessary to establish whether Shri Hazarika was qualified to be appointed as a  tribunal or not were not  gone  into. Shri  Hazarika,  was  an  Additional District &  Sessions Judge, Lower  Assam  Division,  at the time the reference waa made. Assuming that he was not  qualified  under  clause (a)  above,  he  might well have  bPen  qualified under  clause (b},  if  he  had  been a  District  Judge elsewhere before  he  became  an  Ad ditional  District  Judge  in  this  particular  division. Further even if he had  never  been  a  District  Judge, he might be  qualified for  appointment  as  Judge  of  a High Court. proper  procedure had not been  followed,  and  (2)  that Ph  Iba  -:--T  E  1  1  legal  evidence  was  wanting. But considering that  the  Tribunal was also  of  opinion  that  proper  procedure  had  not been followed  we  have still to  see  whether  that  find ing of the Tribunal  justifies  the  conclusion  at  which it  arrived. The  first  ques tion that Das was asked on that day  was  whether  he had anything to say in connection with the disappear ance of two lorry wheels and  tyres  from  the  garage. He  was  then  told that the people who hatl  given  evidence  aga.inst  him were  present a.nd  he should  ask  them what  they  had to say. Then the  witnesses  present  were  asked  whe ther the evidence they had given  before  the  managei: was correct or not ;  and if that was not  correct,  they were at liberty to amend it. show that copies  of  the  state ments made  by  the  witnesses  were  supplied  to  Das before  he was  asked  to  question  them. Further his evidence does not show that t.he  statements which had been recorded were read over  to  Das  at  the  enquiry before  he was asked to  question  the  witnesses. true that  the  statements  which  were  recorded  were Produced on behalf of the  company  before  the  Tri- Ph  lb  -:-T  E h bunal;  but the witnesses  were  not  pro  uce so  t  at they might be cross-examined even  at  that  stage  on behalf  of  Das. The  question  is  whether  in  these circumstances  it  can  be  said  that  an  enquiry  as  Wamhoo J. required by principles of natural justice  was  made  in this case. We may in this connection refer to  Union  of  India v. T.  R.  Varma (1). This Court, speaking through Venkatarama Ayyar J.  observed  as  follows  in  that connection at p.  507 :- \"  Stating it broadly  and  without  intending  it to be exhaustive, it mav be observed that  rules  of  natu ral justice require th.~t a  party should have the oppor tunity \u2022>f  a<ldueing  all  relevant evidence on  which  he relies,  that the  evidence  of  the  opponent  should  bC' taken in his presence, and tha.t he should be given the opportunity of cro::;s,examining  the witnesses exa.min ed by  that  party,  and  that  no  materials  should  be relied  on  agairnit  him  without  his  being  given  an opportunity of explaining them.\" In another case  New  Prakf:tsh  Transport  Co.  Ltd.  v.  New  S'uwarna Transport  Co.  Ltd. (\"),  this  Court  held  that  \" rule;;  of natural justice vary \\vith  the  varying  con;;titutions of statutory bodies  and the rules prescribed by the  legis lature under  which  they  have  to  act, and  the  ques tion  whether  in  a  particular  case  they  have  been contravened  must  be  judged not  by any  preconceiv ed notion  of what  they  may  be  but  in  the  light  of the provisions of the relevant Act\". The narration  of  facts  as to what happened on March 12, which we  have given above, shows that oven  this  was not done in this case,  for  there  is  no  evidence  that. copies  of  the  statements  of witnesses who  had given evidence against Das were  supplied  to  him  or  even that  the  statements  made  by  the  witnesses  to the manager were read  out,  in  extenso  to  Das  before  he was  asked  to  question them. In-these circumstances one of the  basic  principles  of  natural  justice  in  an enquiry  of  this  nature  was not observed, and, there fore,  the finding of the Tribunal that proper procedure had not been followed  is  justified  and  is  not  open  to challenge. This left the  matters  where  they  were and  Das  had never an opport.unity of questioning the witneRRes  after knowing in  full  what  they  had  stated against,  him. In these circumstances we  are of opinion that  the  fiw.ling  of  t.he  \u2022rrilmnal that the enquiry  i11 this case was  uot proper is  correct and must Htand. the parties should hear their own  eosts of thits Court.

Virkumar Gulabchand Shah. 612  OF  1951) [PATANJALI  SASTRI  c.

The  words  \"subject  to\"  in  entry  36  of  List  II  only  mean that  whenever  a  law  is  made  by  a  State  Legislature in  exercise of  its  legislative  power  under  entry  36,  that  law  will  be subject to  the  provisions  of  a  law  made  by  the  Parliament  under  entry  42 of  List  III. The  words  do  not  mean  that  when  a  State  makes  a it  must  lay  down  the  principles  on  which law  under  entry  36 is  to  be  determined compensation  payable  for  property  acquired and  the  form  and  manner  in  which  it  should  be  given. (iv)  Entries  in  the  Lc;gislative  Lists  arc  merely  of  an  enabl- ing  character. 31(2)  and  an  infringement  of  such a  provision  cannot  be  put  forward  as  a  ground  for questioning the  validity  of  an  Act  providing for  compulsory  acquisition. In  any  case  the  impugned  Act  is  supported  by  a public  purpose. Per  MAHAJAN  and  CHANDRASEKHARA  A1YAR  JJ.-The  scope limited  to  the  express  provisions  of  art. 4  clause  (b)  of  the  Act  is  there- fore  unconstitutional  and  void. 31 (2)  either terms  or  even  impliedly  and  conse- quently  thei  question  of  the  existence  of  a  public  purpose  is  not justiciable,  as  the  real  object  of  sec. 4,  clause  (b)  is  to  deprive  the man  of  his  money,  which  is  not  a  subject-matter  for  acquisition under  the  powers  of  eminent  domain,  without  giving  anything in  exchanm  under  the  guise  of  acting  under  entry  4 2  the  legis- in  truth  and  substance  evaded  and  nullified  its  provi- lature  has sions  altogether  and  sec. 4  clause  (b)  is  therefore  unconstitutional and  void. the  pc>1t10n  as regards  the  acquisition  of  money  as  such  it  is  not  correct  to  say law  made  under  entry  36  of  List  II  cannot  authorise that  a acquisition  of  choses  in  action like  arrears  'of  rent  due  from  the tenants  which  are  covered  by  the  term  \"property\"  used that in entry  and  in  art. Section  4  clause  (b)  is  not  therefore  ultra  vires  or  un- constitutional. Per  MAHAJAN,  MuKHERJEA  and  CHANDRASEKHAllA  AIYAR  JJ. (PATANJALI  SAsTRI  C. J.  and  DAs  J.  dissenting).-&xtion  23  (b) of  the  Act  which  provides  for  a  deduction  on  a  percentage  basis out  of  the  gross  asserts  for  \"costs  of  works  of  benefit  to the is  ostensibly  enacted  under  entry  42  of  List  III,  but  it  is raiyat\", merely  a  colourable  piece  of  legislation,  a  mere  device  to  reduce the  gross  assets,  which  does  not  really  come  under  entry  42  and J.  and  DAs  J.-The is  unconstitutional. Further,  as  a  payment  of case  of  the  im~ compensation  is  not  a justiciable  issue pugned  statute,  having  regard  to  arts. 31  (4),  31-A  and  31-B, it is  not  open  to  the  Court  to  enquire  whether  a  reduction  which results is  unwarranted  and  there\u00b7 fore  a  fraud  on  the  Constitution. - Per  DAs  J.-No hard  and  fast  definition  can  be  laid  down as tho  concept  has  been to  what rapidly  changing  in  all  countries,  but  it  is  clear  that  it  is  the presence  of  the  element  of  general  interest  of  the  community in an  object  or  an  aim  that  transforms  such  object  or  aim  into  a public  purpose,  and  whatever interest the  general to  the  particular  interest  of  the the  community  as  opposed of individual  must  be  regarded  as  a  pnblic  purpose. 612  of  1951, the  Constitution  for a  petition  under.

Ray  Parasnath  for  the  respondent  in  Case  No. appeals  and  peti- tions  which  fall  into  three  groups  raise  the  issue  of the  constitutional  validity  of three  State  enactments called The  Uttar  Pradesh  Zamindari  Abolition  and  Land The  common  aim  of  these  statutes,  generally  speak- ing, abolish  zamindaries  and  other  proprietary estates  and  tenures  in  the  three  States  aforesaid,  so  as to  eliminate  the  intermediaries  by  means  of  compul- to sory  acquisition  of  their  rights  and  interests, bring  the  raiyats  and  other  occupants  of  lands  in  those areas  into  direct  relation  with  the  Government. The  appeals  are  directed  against these  decisions. Petitions  have  also  been  filed  in  this Court  under  article  32  by  certain  other  zamindars seeking  determination  of  the  same  issues. The  common question  which  arises  for  consideration these appeals  and  petitions  is  whether  the  three  State  Legis- impugned latures,  whch statutes,  were to  enact though  some  special  points  are  also  involved  in them, a  few  of  these  cases. As  has  been  stated,  various  grounds  of the  new  articles  31-A  and inserting That  Act  by 31-B  purported  to  protect,  generally,  all  laws  provid- ing  for  the  acquisition  of  estates  or  interes.ts therein, and  specifically,  certain three impugned  Acts,  from  attacks  based  on  article  13  read with  other  relevant  articles  of  Part  III  of  the  Consti- tution. And  the  operation  of  these  articles  was  made retrospective  by  providing,  in  section  4  of  the  Amend- ment  Act,  that  article  31-A  shall  be  \"deemed  always that to  have  been none  of  the  specified'  statutes  \"shall  be  deemed  ever to  have  become  void\". Maharaja dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhanga  . It  will  be  noted,  however,  that  articles  31-A  and 31-B  afford  only  limited  protection  against  one  ground of  challenge,  namely  that  the  law  in  question  is  \"in- consistent  with,  or  takes  away  or  abridges  any  of  the rights  conferred  by  any  provisions  of  this  Part\". This is  made  further  clear  by  the  opening  words  of  article 31-A  \"notwithstanding  anything  in  the  foregoing  pro- visions  of  this  Part\". Mr.  P.  R  Das,  leading  counsel  for  the  zamin- dars,  accordingly  based  his  main  argument these proceedings  on  entry  36  of  List  II  and  entry 42  of List  III  which  read  as  follows  : \"36. or  of  a  State  or  for  any  other  public  purpose  is  to  be determined,  and  the  form  and  the  manner  . in  which such  compensation  is  to  be  given\". All  legislation in this  country  authorising  such  acquisition of  property from  Regulation  I  of  1824  of  the  Bengal  Code  down to  the  Land  Acquisition  Act,  1894,  proceeded  on  that footing. The  existence  of  a  public  purpose  and  an obligation  to  pay  compensation  being  thus  the  neces- sary  concomitants  of  compulsory  acquisition  of  private property, term  \"acquisition\"  must  be  construed as  importing,  by  necessary  implication,  the  two  condi- It  is  a  recognised  rule  for  the  con- tions  aforesaid. struction  of  statutes  that,  unless  the  words the statute  clearly  so  demand,  a  statute  is  not  to  be  con- strued  \u00b7 so  as  to  take  away  the  property  of  a  subject v.

The  words  \"sub- ject  to  the  provisions  of  entry  42  of  List  III\"  in  entry  36 reinforce  the  argument,  as  these  words  must  be taken to  mean  that  the  power  to  make  a  law  with  respect  to acquisition  of  property  should  be  exercised  subject to the  condition  that  such  law  should  also  provide for the  matters  referred  to  in  entry  4 2,  in other words,  a two-fold  restriction  as to  public  purpose  and  payment . of  compensation  (both  of  which  are  referred  to  in \u00b7entry  42) is  imposed  on  the  exercise  of  the  law  mak- ing  power  under  entry  36. the  legisla- tive  power  conferred  under  entry  42  is  a  power  coupl- ed  with  a  duty  to  exercise  it  for  the  benefit  of  the owners  whose  properties are  compulsorily  acquired Maharaia dhirajaSir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhanga and  O.t!zers. these ;under  a reasons  the  State  Legislatures,  it  was  claimed,  had  no power  to  make  a  law  for  acquisition  of  property  with- out  fulfilling  the  two  conditions  as  to  public  purpose .and  payment  of  compensation. On  the  basis  of  these  arguments,  counsel  proceeded to  examine  elaborately  various  provisions  of im- pugned  Acts  with  a  view  to  show  that  the  compensation which  they  purport  to  provide  has,  by  \"various  shifts :and  contrivances\",  been  reduced  to  an  illusory figure as  compared  with  the  market  value  of  the properties the  com- acquired.

He  appear- ed  to  concede  what  Mr.  Das  so  strenuously that  those  entries,  concerned  as  they  were  with  the grant  of  power legislate with  respect  to  matters  specified  therein,  could  not  be taken,  as  a  matter  of  construction,  to  import  an  obli-- gation  to  pay  compensation. But  he  maintained that a  constitutional  prohibition  against  compulsory  acqui- sition  of  property  without  public  necessity and  pay- from  what  he- ment  of  compensation  was  deducible called  the  \"spirit  of  the  Constitution\",  which,  accord- ing  to  him,  was  a  valid  test  for  judging  the  constitutio- nality  of  a  statute. The  Constitution,  being  avowedly justice  and  equality  and' \u2022one  for  establishing a  government  of  a free  people  with  only  limited powers, must  be  held  to  contain  an  implied  prohibition  against taking  private  \u00b7 property  without compensation\u00b7 and  in  the  absence  of  a  public  purpose. and  text  books  as  support- ing  the  view  that  a  constitutional  prohibition  can  be derived  by  implication  from  the the  Con-\u00b7 stitution  where  no  expr~s  prohib~tion  has  been enacted  in  that  behalf. only  objections  bas~d  on  alleged  infringements  of  the fundamental  rights  conferred  by  Part  III,  but  if,  from the  other  provisions  thereof  it  could  be  inferred that there  must  be  a  public  purpose  and  payment  of  com- pensation  before  private  property  could  be  compul- the  State,  there  was  npthing  in  the sorily  acquired  by the two  articles  aforesaid to  preclude  objection  on ground  that  the  impugned  Acts  do  not  satisfy these requirements  and  are,  therefore,  unconstitutional. In  addition  to  the  aforesaid  grounds  of attack,  which were  common  to  all  the  three  impugned  statutes, the validity  of  each  of  them  or of some  specific  provisions thereof  was  Aliso  challenged  on  some  special  grounds \u2022 It  will  be  convenient  to  deal  with  them  after  disposing of  the  main  contentions  summarised  above  which  are common  to  all  the  three  batches  of  case~.

The clause  was  evidently  worded  in  that  form  as it  was copied  (with  minor  variations)  from  section  299  (2)  of the  Govesrnment  of  India  Act,  1935,  which  was  un- doubetedly  designed  to  give  effect  to  the  recommenda- tion  of  the  Joint  Parliamentary  Committee  in  para. 369 of  their  Report  that  two  conditions  should  be  imposed on  expropriation  of  private  property  :  \"We think it  (the  provision  proposed)  should  secure  that  legisla- tion  expropriating  or  authorising  the  expropriation  of the  property  of  private  individuals  should  be  lawful only  if  confined  to  expropriation  for  public  purpose first and  if  compernation,  is  determined  either  in  the instance  or  in  appeal  by  some  independent  authority\". intended  to It  is secure  fulfilment  of to  which expropriation  of  private alone  legislation  authorising property  should  be  lawful,  and  it  seems  reasonable  to to conclude legislation  ex- impose other  words, propriating article  31 (2)  must  be  understood  as  also providing that  legislation  authorising  expropriation  of  private property  should  be  lawful  only  if  it  was  required  for for  pay- a  public  purpose  and  provision  was  made Indeed  if  this  were  not  so, ment  of  compensation. there  would  be  nothing  in  the  Constitution  to  prevent acquisition  for  a  non-public  or  private  purpose  and result. without  payment  of  compensation-an the It  cannot  be supposed the Constitution,  while  expressly of two  well-established  restrictions to  be the  right  of  eminent  domain,  left law.

The  denial,  however,  seems  to me  to  be  based  on  a  quibbling  distinction  without  a really difference  in  substance. But this  is  only  a  form  of  stating  the  objection  which,  in that  the  statutes  are  bad  because  of  the substance,  is absence  of  a  public  purpose  and  the  omission  to  pro- vide  for  a  just  compensation. tion-for  both  alike Indeed,  if  the  objection  based  on  the  absence  of a public  purpose  and  of  a  provision  for  just  compensa- tion  were  still  to  be  open,  clause  ( 4)  of article 31  would - that be  meaningless  surplusage. that is  obvious impugned clause  was  specially  designed  to  protect  the from  attack statutes  and  other  laws  similarly  enacted in a  court  of  law  on  the  aforesaid  grounds  and,  if  they were  nevertheless  to  be  considered  as  not  being  within the  protection,  it  is  difficult  to  see  what  the  use  of article  31 ( 4)  would  be. Learned  counsel  were  unable is  that  article  31 ( 4)  was to  suggest  any. Maharaja dhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhanga and  Others. to  consider these  grounds  of  objection,  they  are, in  my  op1mon, unsustainable. As  po!nted  out  already,  article  31-A operates  as  an  except10n  to  article  31  (2) read  with article  13,  only laws  authorising  ac- quisition  of and thdein, rights and this  exception  is  to  be  deemed  to  have  been  part  of the  Constitution  from  its  commencement. But it  has no  application  to  laws  authorising  acquisition  of  other kinds  of  property  and,  as  regards  these, require- ments  as  to  public  purpose  and  payment  of  compen- sation  are  still  enforced  by  the  express  provisions  of article  31(2). the State's  power  of  compulsory  acquisition incor- porated  in  the  body  of  the  Constitution,  from  which \"estates\"  alone  are  excluded,  it  would,  in  my  opinion, to  elementary  canons  of  statutory  con- be  contrary struction  to  read,  by  implication, limita- in  conjunction tions  into  entry  36  of  List  II,  alone  or with entry  42  of  list  III  of  the  Seventh  Schedule,  or  to the  Constitution\", deduce  them and  that,  c  too, properties excluded. It  is  true  that  under  the  common law  of  eminent domain  as  recognised  in  the  jurisprudence  of  all  civi- lized  countries,  the  State  cannot  take the  property  of its  subject  unless  such  property  is  required  for  a  public purpose  and  without  compensating  the  owner for  its loss. But,  when  these  limitations  are  expressly  pro- law  shall vided  for  and  it  is  further  enacted  that  no safe- be  made  which  takes  away  or  abridges if  made,  shall  be  void, guards,  and  any  such  law, the  words there  can  be  no  room  for  implication,  and \"acquisition  of  property\"  must  be  understood  in their natural  sense  of  the  act  of  acquiring  property,  without importing  into to  pay Maharaja dhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhang11 and  Others. itself  to  show that in entry  36  of  list  II  does  not  in  itself  carry  any  obli- to  pay  compensation. Similarly,  clall!se  (5) (b ),  which excepts  certain  categories  of  \"laws\"  from the  opera- tion  of  clause  (2),  contemplates\u00b7 laws  being  made  with- out  a  public  purpose  or  payment  of compensation. Such  laws  can  be  made  by  a  State  Legislature  only under  entry  36  which  must,  therefore,  be taken  to implied confer  a  legislative  power  unfettered  by  any restrictions. Whatever  may position  as  to  a  taxing  law,  in  regard  to  the  source  of legislative  power,  laws. under  heads  (2)  and  (3)  of sub- clause  (b)  must  necessarily  be  referable  to,  and  derive under the their  competence  from entry  36  of  List  II,  in  so  far  as  they  purport  to  autho- rise  acquisition  of  any  property,  for  the  police  power of the  State  is  only  the  general  power  to  regulate  and in control  the  exercise  of  private  rights  and  lioerties the  interests  of  the  community  and  does  not  represent any  specific  head  of  legislative  power. And  even  that answer  is  not  available to clause  ( 4). to It  was  said  that  the  words  \"subject to provisions  of  entry  42  in  List  III\"  must  be  taken 36 mean that  the  law-making  power  under  entry could  only  be  exercised  subject  to  the  two  conditions as  to  public  purpose  and  payment  of  compensation, entry. Those both  of  which  are  referred  to  in words,  in  my  opinion,  mean  no  more  than  that  any law  made  under  entry  36  by  a  State  Legislature  can the  Union  Legislature be  displaced  or  overridden  by they making  a  law  under  entry  42  of  List  III. Tha.t to  \u2022 be  put  upon cannot  bear  the  interpretation  sought them  by  Mr.  Das  is  clear  from  the  fact  that similar words  do  not  occur  in  entry  33  of  List  I which  confers on  Parliament  the  power  of  making  laws  with  respect to  acquisition  or  requisitioning  of  property the purposes  of  the  Union. For  if  the  restrictive  condi- to  public  purpose  and  pay_ment  of  compensa\u2022 tions  as it then tion  are  to  be  derived  only  from  those  words, must  follow  that  in  the  absence  of  those  words in entry  33, authorising acquisition  or  requisitioning  of  property  without  a public  purpose  and  a  provision  for  compensation. No legislation suggested  why  parliamentary reason  was requisitioning  of with respect conC!i- property  is  to  be  free restrictive tions  while  State  legislation  should  be  subject  to them. The  fact is  that  the  law-making  power  of  both  Parlia- ment  and  State  Legislatures exercised  only subject  to  the  aforesaid  two  restrictions,  not  by  reason of  anything  contained  in  the  entries themselves,  but by  reason  of  the  positive  provisions  of  article  31  (2), and,  as  laws  falling  under  article  31  ( 4)  or  under articles  31-A  and  31-B  cannot  be  called  in  question those  pre>- in  a  court  of  law  for  non-compliance  with visions,  such  laws  cannot  be  struck  down  as  uncon- stitutional  and  void. It was  further  contended  that  the  power  to  make  a law  under  entry  42  of  List  III  was  a  power  coupled with  a  duty,  because  such  law  was  obviously  intended ( 1 ) That  case,  however,  has  no  application  here. While certain  powers  may  be  granted  in  order to  be  exer- cised  in  favour  of  certain  persons  who  are  intended  to be  benefited  by that  account may  well  be  regarded  as  coupled  with  a  duty  to  exer- cise  them  when  an  appropriate  occasion their the  power  granted  to  a  legislature  to exercise  arises, make  a  law  with  respect cannot  be to  any  matter brought  under  that  category. It  cannot  possibly  have been  intended  that  the  legislature  should  be  under  an obligation  to  make  a  law  in  exercise  of  that  power,  for no obligation  of  that  kind  can  be  enforced  by  the  court against  a  legislative  body. Maharaia dhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh of  /)arbhanga and  Others. to  him  after  it  is  passed  by clause  (3) of  article  31, reference  has  been  made earlier,  is  equally  untenable. that the true the  Governor \"Legislature\"  of  a  State such  Legislature and  that  a passed cannot  become  a  law  until the  Gover- nor's  assent. The  first  proviso, to  that  article  deals  with  a  situation  where  the  Gover- nor  is  bound  to  give  his  !lssent  and  has  no  relevance here. article  31  (3)  provides  a special  safeguard  which,  in  order  to  ensure  that ne> is  passed  by legislation hasty  or  unjust  expropriatory a  State  Legislature,  requires  for  such the legislation assent  of  both  the  Governor  and  the  President,  and,  to the  words  \"law\"  and  \"legislature\" make  this  clear, I  am  unable  to were  deliberately  used is  not agree  with  this  view. Article 31  (4),  for  instance,  speaks  of  a \"bill\" being  reserved  for  the  President's  assent  \"after  it  has been  passed\"  by a  State\"  and  of \"the  law  so  assented  to.\" \"passed to  mean  \"passed by the by to assented as  Mr.  Somayya  would  have by to  be  a  \"bill\" it  understood,  then,  it  would  cease is the and  could  no  longer  be  reserved  as  such. Nor as phrase  \"law  so  assented  to,'  strictly  accurate, the it  clear  that previous  portion  of  the the  President's  assent  and  what is  reserved  for what he  assents  to  is  a  \"bill\"  and  not  a law. The  phrase obviouslv  refers  to  what  has  become  a  law  after  recei- Similarly, ving article  31(3)  must,  in  my  judgment,  be  understood  as On  the  other hand,  as  we have  seen,  where the reservation  by Governor  is  made  obligatory,  he  is  prohibited from giving  his  assent. Maharaja dhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhang11 and\u00b7 Others. In  the  view  I  have  expressed  above  that  the  objec- tions  based  on  the  lack  of  a  public  purpose  and  the failure  to  provide  for  payment  of just  compensation are  barred  under  article  31(4)  and  are  also  devoid  of of  merits,  it  becomes  unnecessary  to  consider  what is acquisition  autho- a  public  purpose  and  whether rised  by  the  impugned  statutes  subserves any  public purpose. Nor  is it  necessary  to  examine  whether  the scheme  of  compensation  provided  for  by the  statutes is  so  illusory  as expropriated  owners without  any for their loss  of property. Turning  now  to  the  special  points  ansmg  in  parti- cular  cases,  it  was  urged  by  Mr.  Das  that  section  4(b) that  all  arrears  of of  the  Bihar  Act,  which  provides rent,  royalti~  and  cesses  due  for  any  period  prior to the  date  of  the  vesting  of  the  estates  in  Government \"shall  vest  and  be  recoverable  by the  State\"  was  un- In  the  first  place,  there  was constitutional  and  void. the  acquisition  of no  public  purpose such  property. lacked evidently illusory  com- funds  for accord- and pensation  provided these ingly, acquiring hit  upon arrears  on  payment  of  only their 50  per  cent.

Secondly,  it  was  said  that 'arrears'  would  represent  so  much  money  when these realised,  and  money  could  not  be  the  subject  of  com- pulsory  acquisition  as  the  obligation  to  pay  compensa- tion  would  practically into  a turn  such forced  loan. Whatever  may  be  the  position  as regards  the  acquisition  of  money  as  such,  it is  not correct  to  say  that  a  law  made  under  entry  36  of  List II  cannot  authorise  acquisition  of  choses  in  action  like arrears  of  rent  due  from  the  tenants  which  are  covered by  the  term  \"property\"  used in article  31. It  is  equally  fallacious  to  argue  that  a  pay- ment  in  cash  or  in  Government  bonds  of  half  the the  zemindar  without leaves amount  of  such  arrears It compensation  for  the  balance. to is  unrealistic remained  uncollected assume  that  arrears  which  had the  zemindar  as over  a  period  of  years  during  which the  advantage  of  summary  remedies  and landlord  had so  much other  facilities money  or  money's  worth  in  his  hands  when  he  was  to cease  to  he  a  landlord  and  to  have  no  longer  those remedies  and  facilities. of  the  face  value  of the entire  arrears  must,  as it  seems  to  me,  be  considered reasonable  and  fair  compensation  for  taking  them  over. Indeed,  the  contention  leaves  one almost  wondering what  aavantage  the  zemindars  would  gain  by  seeking to  overthrow  a  provision  in  the  Act  which  may  well prove  beneficial  to  them. However  tillit  may  be, for indicated,  article  31(4)  bars  a the to challenge  on  these  two  grounds,  and  the  objections section  4(b)  cannot  be  entertained.

It  will  be  recalled that  the  High  Court  of  Patna  held  the  Bihar  Act  un- in  providing  for constitutional  as  being  discriminatory payment  of  compensation,  and  it  was to  overcome that  difficulty that  articles and  31-B  were inserted  in  the  Constitution. conceded  by the  learned 'Madhya  Pradesh these  malguzari  lands  could  not  be  \u00b7  regarded that as  estates  within  the  meaning  of read in  Madhya  Pradesh, with  the  Tenancy  Acts  in  force but  he  contended  that,  inasmuch  as  article  31-B  pur- ported  to  validate  specifically the  Madhya  Pradesh Act  among  others,  and  as  that  article  was  not  limited in  its  application  to  estates,  the  objection  could  not that prevail. Mr.  Somayya,  however,  submitted the opening  words  of  article  31-B,  namely, \"Without prejudice  to  the  generality  of the  provisions  contained in  article  31-A\"  showed  that  the  mention  of  parti- the  Ninth cular  statutes  in  article  31-B  read  with accordingly, and  that, Schedule  was  only  illustrative, article  31-B  could  not  be  wider scope. sion  of  the  Privy  Council I  cannot  agree  with  that  view. There  is  nothing  in article  31-B  to  indicate  that the  specific  mention  of Maharaja dhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhang~ and  Others. The opening  words  of  article  31-B  are  only to make  clear  that  article  31-A  should  not  be  restricted in  its  application  by  reason  of  anything  contained  in article  31-B  and  are in  no  way  calculated  to  restrict the  application  of  the  latter  article  or  of  the  enactments referred  to  therein  to  acquisition  of \" estates. \" The decision  cited  affords  no  useful  analogy. In  these  cases  it  was  urged that  estates sought  to  be  acquired  formed  part  of  the  Rulers'  \"per- instrument sonal  rights\"  guaranteed  to  them  under impugned  statutes  nor of  merger,  and  that  neither the the  notifications\u00b7  issued  thereunder  could  deprive article Ruler  of  such  properties  in  contravention  of 362. The  Attorney-General  had  several to this  argument,  including  the  bar  under  article  363  to interference  by  courts  in  disputes  arising  out  of  agree- ments,  covenants,  etc.,  by  Rulers  of  Indian  States to which  the  Government  of  India  was  a  party. But  a no short  and  obvious  answer contravention assurance covenant  of given  by merger,  as to \"private  property\"  of be  acquired otherwise. The  compensation the  Rulers  and  not provided  for,  such  as  it  is,  is  in  recognition  of  their private  proprietorship,  as  in  the  case  of  any  other owner. There  is,  therefore,  no  force  in  this  objection. 285  of  1951  preferred  by  the  Raja  of Kapurthala,  where  a  similar  objection  was it was  further  alleged  that  the  privy  purse  of  the  Ruler was  fixed  at  a  low  figure  in  consideration  of  the  Oudh Estate  being  left  to  be  enjoyed  by  him  as  his  plivate property,  and taking  over  would deprive  him  of  the  means  of  discharging  his  liability to  maintain the the abse!Jce  of  any  material  to  establish allegation  calls  for  no\u00b7 consideration.

Kent  speaks  of  it  as  an  inherent sovereign  power. As  an  incident  to  thi,<;  power  of  the State the  requirement  that  property  shall  not  be taken  for  public  use  without  just  compensation. Mr. Broom  in  his  work  on  Constitutional  Law  says,  \"Next in  degree  to  the  right  of  personal  liberty  is  that  of enjoying  private  property  without  undue interference that  property or  molestation,  and shall  not  be  taken  for  public  use  without  just  compen- sation  is  but  an  aflirmance  of  the  great  doctrine  esta- blished  by  the  common  law  for the  protection  of  pri- vate  property.

This term  seems  to  have  been  originated  in  1625  by  Hugo Grotius,  who  wrote  of  this  power  in  his  work \"De  Jure Belli  et  Pacis''  as  follows  : the  eminent domain  of  the  State,  so  that  the  State  or  he  who  acts for  it  may  use  and  even  alienate  and  destroy such extreme  necessity, property,  not  only  in  the  case  of in  which  even  private  persons  have  a right  over  the property  of  others,  but  for  ends  of  public  utility, to  which  ends  those  who  founded  civil  society  must be  supposed ends that  private should  give  way.

As been made  a  compulsory  part  of  a  statute  that  purports  to legislate  under  entry  33  of  List  I  and  entry  36  of List  II,  it  is  not  possible  to  accede to  the  contention of  Mr.  P.  R.  Das  that  the  duty  to  pay  compensation is  a  thing  inherent  in agree  with  the that tlY. Power  to  take  was  mentioned while the  exercise  of\u00b7  that  power was  embodied  in  article  31 (2)  and  there  was  no  duty to  pay  compensation  implicit  in  the  content  of the entry  itself. Reference  m  this  connection  may  be  made  to  the Government  of  India  Act,  1935. The  Constitution, de- clared  laws  not  providing  for  compensation  \u00b7 as  void and  it  not  only  placed  a  fetter  on  the  power  of  legis. lation  but  it  guaranteed  the  expropriated  proprietor  a remedv  in  article  32  of  the  Constitution  for  enforce- I  am  therefore  of  the ment opinion  that  Mr.  Das  is  not  right in  his  contention that  unless  adequate  provision is  made  by  a  law  en- acted  under  legislative  power  conferred  by  entry  36  of List  I  for  compensation,  the  law is  unconstitutional as  entry  36 itself  does  not  authorize  the  making  of such  a  law  without  providing  for  compensation. Maharaja dhiraja  Sir Kami:shwar Singh of  Darbhanga and  Others. it  was  said  that  entry  36  of  List  II  was  linked  up  with the  words  \"subject entry  42  of  the  Concurrent  List  by to\"  occurring  therein  and  that  the  validity  of  any law legislative  power  under  entry  36 mad<'. in  exercise  of the the  simultaneous  exercise  of was  conditional  on legislative  power  under  entry  42 there has  been  no  valid  exercise  of this  power  (the  pro- visions  of  the  impugned  Act  regarding  the  determina- legislation tion  of  compensation  being In  my  opinion,  this  contention under  entry  36  fails. The  two  entries  referred  to are merely  heads  of are  neither  inter- legislation It  is dependent  nor  complementary  to  one  another. by  force  of  the  provisions  of  article  31  (2)  that  it  be- comes  obligatory  to  legislate  providing compen- sation  under  entry  42  of  the  Concurrent  List  in  order to  give  validity  to  a  law  enacted  under  entry  36  and not  by  reason  of  the  use  of  the  words  \"subject  to\"  in the  wording  of  the  entry. No  such  words  occur in It  cannot  reasonably  be entry  33  of  the  Union  List. that  Parliament  could  make  a  law  for  com- argued pulsory  acquisition  of  property  for  hs  purposes  with- out  fulfilling  the  condition  of  making a  law  under entry  42  of  the  Concurrent  List,  but  a  State  Legis- lature  in  this  respect  is  in  a  different  situation. Such a  contention,  in  my  opinion,  is  untenable. The  only purpose  of in entry  36  is  to  indicate  that  legislation  under  entry  36 in would  be  subject exercise  of  its  legislative  power  under  entry  42  of  the Concurrent  List. Both  legislatures  can  legislate  under entry  42  but in exercise  of  powers  under  this  entry  would  have  pre- ference  over  a  State  law  in  case  of  repugnancy  and  it was  for  this  reason  that  reference  was  made  to  entry  42 in  the  head  of  legislation  mentioned  in  the  State  List under  entry  36. that whenever  a  law  is  made  by  a  State  Legislature  in  exer- cise  of  its  legislative  power  under  entry  36, law the  provisions  of  a  Parliamentary will  be  subject  to legislative  powers statute  made under  entry  42  of  the  C'nncurrent  List. Maharaja dhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhanga and  Others. legislative  power conferred in  entry  42  of  the  Concurrent  List  is  a power the  expropriated  owner conferred  for and  that  the  legislature this power  for  his  benefit  whenever  it  takes  property  under its  compulsory  powers,  in  other  words,  it  was said that  the  power  conferred  by  the  entry  was  coupled with  a  duty  to  exercise  it. Reference  was  made in this  connection  to  the  observations  of  Lord  Cairns  in Julius  v.  Bishop  of  Oxford(1). These  o.bservations  do not  have  any  apposite  application  to  the  case  of  legis- constitution. The lative  powers entries  in  the  lists  are  merely  legislative  heads and are  of  an  enabling  character. Duty  to  exercise  legis- in  a  particular  manner  cannot  be lative  power  and If  the  argument read \u00b7into  a  mere  head  of  legislation. Mr.  Das,  when  faced with  this  question,  had  to  admit  that  he could  not seriously  contend  that  a  legislature  could  be  directed to  enact  a  statute  if  it  did  not  wish  to  do  so. Failure to  make  a  law  under  entrv  42  cannot  make  a law Ii1  my  opinion,  the  decision made  under  entry  36  bad. in  the  case  of  Julms  v.  Bishop  of  Oxford(')  has  no relevancy  to  the  matter  before  us. The  crucial  point  for  determination  in  these  appeals ( 4)  of to  discover  the  extent  to  which  article  31 h the  Constitution  or  the  new  articles  31-A and  31-B have of  his rights  or  remedies  in  respect  of  this  matter  and  of  the guaranteed  right  to  get property for acquired. this  Constitution  in  the  legislature  of after  it  has  been  passed  by (1)  (1880)  5  App. the  commencement  of a  State  has, such  Legislature,  been (1)  Notwithstanding  anything  in  the  fore- going  provisions  of  this  Part,  no  law  providing  for  the acquisition  by  the  State  of  any  estate  or  of  any  rights therein  or  for  the  extinguishment  or  modification  of any  such  rights  shall  be  deemed  to  be  void  on the ground  that  it  is  inconsistent  with,  or  takes  away  or abridges  any  of the  rights  conferred pro- visions  of  this  Part : Maharaja dhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhanga and  Others. the  Legislature  of  a  State, Article shall  not  apply having  been  reserved  for dent  has  received  his  assent. to any ex- pression  or  its  local  equivalent  has  in  the  existing  law relating  to  land  tenures  in  force  in  that  area  and  shall also  include  any  jagir,  inam  or  musafi  or  other  similar grant; an estate,  shall  include  any  rights  vesting  in  a  proprietor, tenure-holder  or sub-proprietor, other  intermediary in respect  of  land  revenue. the  generality  of  the provisions  contained  in  article  31-A,  none  of  the  Acts and  Regulations  specified  in  the  Ninth  Schedule  nor any  of  the  provisions  thereof  shall  be  deemed  to  be void  or  even  to  have  become  void,  on  the  ground  that such  Act,  Regulation  or  provision  is  inconsistent  with, or  takes  away  or  abridges  any  of  the  rights  conferred by  any  provisions  of  this  Part,  and  notwithstanding any  jmlgment,  decree  or  order  of  any  court  or  tribunal Maharaja dhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhanga and  Others. to  the  contrary,  each  of  the  said  Acts  and  Regulations shall,  subject  to  the  power  of  any  competent  legislature to  repeal  or  amend  it,  continue  in  force.\" In order  to  determine  the  scope  of  this  clause,  it  is necessary  to  determine  what  are  the  specific  provisions of  clause  (2)  which  clause  ( 4)  makes  unjusticiable. A strict  construction  has  to  be  placed  on  the  language  of this  clause,  it  being  in  the  nature  of a  debarring  pro- sub-clause vision. (2)  made  unjusticiable  by  clause  (4), to  the relate determination  and compensation. 8,  p.  1526) used  in  statutes,  has  reference  to  what is  expressly provided really ( 4) the says express provisions  of  article  31 (2)  relating payment  of compensation  will  not  be  a  justiciable  issue. expressly  make  it  a  condition  precedent  to  acquisition. It  assumes  that  compulsory  acquisition  can  be for  a \"public  purpose\"  only,  which  is  thus  inherent  in  such acquisition. Hence  article  31(4),  in  my  opinion,  does inquiring not  bar  the  jurisdiction  of  the  court  from whether  the  law  relating  to  compulsory  acquisition  of property is  not being  made  for  a  public  purpose. The  sovereign  power  to  acquire  property  compulsorily is  a  power  to  acquire  it  only  for a  public  purpose. Reference  in to be  made Willoughby's  Constitutional  Law  (page  795). Public  purpose  is  an  essential  ingredient  in  the  very definition  of as given  by  Nichols  and  other  constitutional  writers,  even though  obligation  to  pay  compensation  is  not  a  content of  the  definition  but  has  been  added  to  it  by  judicial to  acquire interpretation. Mahara;a dhiraia  Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga and  Others. acquisition  of  property  compulsorily  for  public  purpose but  the  barring  provisions  of  article  31(4)  <lo  not  in  any way  touch  the  powers  of  the  court  to  see  whether  the acquisition  has  been  made  for  public  purpose. The the provisions  of  this  clause  also  Jo  not  take  away court's  power  to  examine  whether  the  legislature  that made  the  law  has  acted  in  exercise  of  its  law  making power  within  the  lists  or  has  merely  made  some  other law  though  it  has  ostensibly  exercised  its  powers  under a  certain  legislative  head  which cannot  be  used  to support  the  legislation. Mr.  Das  is  to  a  great  extent  right  in  his  contention -the  point  was  not  seriously  challenged  by  the  learned Attorney-Gcneral,-that in the  matter  of  compensation  is  highly  unjust  or  inequi- table  to  certain  persons  and  in  certain  matters, and compensation  in  some  cases illusory. Be terms that  as express prohibits  an  enquiry  in  a  court  of into those law matters. However impugned law  may  be  to  our  sense  of  justice, is  not  possible the  appropriate legislature  to  see  if  it  can  revise  some  of its  unjust provisions  which  are  repugnant  to  all  notions  of  justice and  are  of  an  illusory  nature. The  courts'  hands  are tied  by  the  provisions  of  article  31 ( 4)  and  that  which has  been  declared  by  the  Constitution  in  clear terms not  to  be  justiciable,  cannot  be  made  justiciable  in  an subject- indirect  manner  by  holding matter  which  is  expressly  barred  is  contained impli- citly  in  some  other  entry  and  therefore  open  to  exa- mination. Mr.  Das  contended,  and in  my  opinion  rightly,  that acqmre private  property  by  legislation  can  only  be exercised for  a  public  purpose. \"We  are,  in  my  opm10n,  estopped  from  saying  that the  acquisition  of  estates  and tenures  is  not  an  acqui- sition  for  such  a  purpose. That  it  is,  has  been  decided by  the  Constituent  Assembly  itself.\" This  decision  was  reached  in  view  of Reuben  J. their  express  approval observed  as  follows  :- that the \"From  article  31,  clause  (2), requirements Constituent  Assembly  considered a as  essential compensation. The public  purpose  and  provision  for protection  which gave under  clauses  ( 4)  and  ( 6)  was  confined  to  the  latter Constituent requirement. Assembly  thought  that  protection  was  not reqaued under  the  other  head,  that  is  to  say,  the  Constituent Assembly  regarded  that  nationalization  of as  it- self  constituting  a  public  purpose. I  would,  therefore,  hold  that  there  is  a pose  for  the  impugned  Act  within clause  (2)  of  article  31.\" Das  J.  said  as  follows  :- \"There  is,  I  think,  clear  indication  in  the  Constitu. tion  of  India  itself  that  the  expression  'public  purpose' comprehensive is sense. This is  clear  from  clause  ( 4)  of  article  31. If  the  legis- lation  then  pending  was  not  for  a  public  purpose,  it was, the  Constituent  Assembly tried  to  save  such  legislation  by  means  of  the  provi- sions  of  clause  (4)  of  article  31. One  may,  I  think, implied  declaration  by say  that the Constitue11t  Assembly that  such  legislation  was  for  a public  purpose  and  such  declaration  will  be  given deference  by  the  courts  until  it  is  shown  to  involve  an impossibility. the  Land  Reforms  Hill  was  pending  at Maharaja dhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhanga and  Others. are tenure-holders  m  Bihar 13,35,000 and and  if  an  average  family  be  taken  to  consist  of four persons,  five  and  a  half  million  people  will  be  ruined by legislation,  while  the  ryots  will  not.

Next  it  was  contended  that  the  impugned  Act  is  a fraud  on  the  Cunstitution  and  therefore  void. It  was said  that  the  Act,  while  pretending to  comply  with it ;  that  the  Act the  Constitution,  evades  and  invades merely  pretends  to  comply  with  the  Constitution  when it  says that  it  provides  for  payment  of  compensation but in  effect  it  has  produced  a  scheme  for  non-payment of  compensation  by  shift  and  contrivance. fiscatory  nature,  already Section  9  was  mentioned  under  which  mines  in the income  yet -course  of  development  and Maharaja dhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhanga and  Others. vest  in  the  State  without  payment  of  compensation.

Reference  was  made  to  a  passage Proprietary  Ltd.  v.  Dy.

It  was  urged  that  a  statute  could  be  declared to  be same  principles a  fraud  on that  are  applicable corporations  or  of executive  bodies,  whether in abuse  of their  statutory  powers. Reliance  was  placed in  this  connction  on  the  observations  of  Abbott  C.J. in  Fox  v.  Bishop  of  Chester(\"),  which  are these terms:- In Fox  v.

Section  23(f),  however,  in  my  opinion,  is  a  colour- It  has  been  enacted  under able  piece  of  legislation. power  conferred  by  legislative  entry  42  of  List  III. It  is  well-settled  that  Parliament  with  limited  powers cannot  do  indirectly  what  it  cannot  do  directly. (Vide South  Australia  v.  The  Commonwealth(')  and  Madden v.  Nelson  &  P<>rt  Sheppard  R.  W.  Co.(2). In  Deputy Federal  Commissioner  of  Taxation  (N.  S.  W.)  v.  W.R. Moran  Proprietary  Ltd. (8 as ), follows:- \"Where  the  law-making  authority  is  of  a cannot  disobey  the  prohibition  merely by  employing  an  indirect  method  of  achieving  exactly the  same  result ........ The  same  issue  may  be  whether legislation  whieh  at  first  sight  appears to  conform  to constitutional  requirlements  is  co~ble  or  disguised. In  such  cases the  court  may  have  to  look  behind names,  form  and  appearances  to  determine  whether or not  the  legislation  is  colourable  or  disguised.\" The  State  legislature  is authorised to  pass  an  Act  in  the  interests  of  persons  deprived  of They  could  not  be  permitted under  that  power  to  pass  a  law  that  operates the detriment  of the  object  of  which those  persons  and provision  is  to  deprive  them  of  the  right  of  compen- sation  to  a  certain  extent. He  contended  that  under  this  head it  was open  to  the  Parliament  or  the  State  Legislature  to  make a  law  laying  down  the  principles  which  may  result  in non-payment  of  compensation  or  which  may  result  in not  paying  any  compensation  whatsoever. I  cannot possibly  assent  to  any  such  construction  of  this  entry. \"Principles  on  which  compensation  for  property acquired  or  requisitioned  for  purposes  of  the  Union  or of  a  State  or for  any  other  public  purpose  is to  be determined,  and  the  form  and  manner  in  which  such compensation This  head  of  legislation  seems  to  have been  expressly mentioned  in  the  Concurrent  List  not  only  in  view  of the  accepted  principle  of  law  that  in  cases  of  compul- sory  acquisition  of  property  compensation  has to  be made  but  also  in  view  of  the  clear  and  mandatory law provisions  of  article  31(2)  which  require authorising  the  taking  or  acquisition  of  propeny  will be  void  if  it  does  not  provide  for  payment  of  compen- sation  for  the  property  acquired  or  does  not  either  fix the  amount  of  compensation  or  specify  the  principles on  which  and  the  manner  in  which  the  compensation is  to  be  determined  and  given. The  power  of  legisla- tion  in  entry  42  is  for  enacting  the  principles  of  deter- paying  it. But  it  is  difficult to  imagine  that  there  can  be  any  principles  fur  non- payment  of  compensation  or  for  negativing  the  pay- ment  of  compensation. No  principles  are  required to be  stated  for  non-payment  of  compensation. A  simple statement  that  no  compensation  will  be  paid  is  quite I  know  of  no principles __ ior enough  to  attain  the  object. AlCfcgiS: lative  heads  have  to  be  reasonably  construed  and  the power  given  under  entry  42  is  a  positive  power  given\u00b7 to  bring  about  the  resuit  of  payment  of  compensation and  not  non-payment  of  the  same. Any- thing  that  is  no.related  to  compensation  or  the  giving of  it  cannot  be  justified  by  legislation  under  entry  42, Reference  was  made  in  this  connection  to  the  United Provinces v.  Atiqa  Begum('),  in  which  it  was  held  that the  descriptive  words  under legislative  head - \"collection  of  rents\"  are  wide  .enough  to  permit  k~- lation  in  respect  of  remission  \u00b7of  rents  and  that  under the item  22  of  the  Government  of  India  Act, legislative  head  \"forests\"  include  the  power  to legis- late  with  respect  not  only  to  afforestation  but  also  to disafforestation  and  that  the  legislative  head  \"fisheries\" to  legislate  on  the  prohibi- would tion  of these analogies  have  no  application  . to  the construction  of the  language  employed  in  entry  42,  These  entries  are not  in  par[  materia  to  entry  42. Perhaps  a  more analogous  case  on  the  point  is  the  decision  in  Attorney General  for  Ontario  v.

Even the earlier provision  in clause (d)  that costs of management have to be deducted up to twenty per cent. has in its entirety no real relation  to actual state of  affairs. -such  legislation,  in  my op1mon,  is  not  permitted  by  entry  42  of List III. it  declared that a  deduction of  seventy per cent. This provision, therefore, in my opinion has  been  inserted in the Act as a  colourable exercise of legislative power under entry 42 and is unconstitutional on that ground. The power has not  been  exercised - under  any -- other legislative  head  authorizing  the  State legislature to pass such a  law. Reference  in  this  connection may  also  be  made  to  the  decision  of  the  Privy  Council in  Madden  v.  Nelson  &  Fort  Sheppard  R.  W.  Co.  ('). legislation is  unconstitutional This  clause made  colourable  valid  under  exercise  of legislative power  under  entry  42  of  List  II. It  was  contended  by  Mr.  Das  that  if some  provisions in  the  Act  are  ultra  vires,  the  statute  as  a  whole  must be  pronounced  to  be  ultra  vires  and  that  it could  not be  presumed  that  the  legislature  intended  to  pass  it  in what  may  prove  to  be  a  truncated  form. real The is  whether  what quc:stion  to  decide  in  all  such  cases reamins  is  so  inextricably  bound  up  with the  part declared  invalid  that  what  remains  canno~  independ- as  it  has  sometimes  been  put, ently whether  on  a  fair  review  of  the  whole  matter  it  can  be assumed  that  the  legislature  would  have enacted  at all  that  which  survives  without  enacting  the  part  that is  ultra  vires. In  this  case legislature a  presumption  cannot  be  drawn would  not  have  enacted  the  Act  leaving  out  the two to  be  declared  to  be or  three  provisions  which  have invalid. Reference  was  made which  runs  as  follows  :- The  bonds  shall  be  either  negotiable or  non-negotiable  and  non-transferable  and  be  payable in  forty  equal  instalments  to  the  person  named  the1ein and  shall  carry  interest  at  two  and  a  half  per  centum per annum  with  effect  from  the  date  of  issue.\" It was  contended  that  as  no  date  has  been  ment_ion- ed  for  payment  of  compensation  and  no interval  has been  stated  between  the  instalments  mentioned  therein and  it has  not  been  mentioned  how  much  would  be payable  in  cash  and  how  much in  bonds,  the Act  could not  be  enforced. It  seems  clear  that  the  Act  has  made  sufficient  provi- sion  for  enforcing  its  provisions  if  section  32(2)  is  read with  the  provisions  contained and it cannot  be  said for  this reasi;.>n. in  section  43 that  the  Act  is  unenforceable The  last  point  urged  by  M.

A  two-fold  attack  was  levelled  against  this prov1S1on.

The  proportion  in  which  compensation  was  payable  in cash  or  in  bonds  or  whether  the  whole  of  it  was  to  be paid  in  cash  is  a  matter  which  only  the  State  Govern- ment  could  fix  and  similarly, instal- ments  and  the  period  of  redeemability  of the  bonds were  also  matters  of  detail  which the;  \u00b7 executive  could .more  oppositely  determine  in  exercise  of  its  rule-mak- It  cannot  be  said  in  this  case that  any mg  power. rule-making  authority  abuses its  power  or  makes  any attempt  to  make  the  payment  illusory,  the expropriat- ed  proprietor  will  not  be  without  a  remedy. For  the  reasons  given  above,  I  am  of the  opinion that section  32(2)  of  the  Act  cannot be  held  bad  on  the ground  that  it  is  a  piece  of  unregulated  delegation  of legislative  power. v.

The  rest  seem  to  me  to I  have  discussed to  notice  a  few be  unsubstantial  but laid  by  the of  them  upon  which  great learned  counsel. This argument  really  has  no  force,  because the  provisions as  to  a~sessment of  compensation  enacted the  Land in Acquisition  Act  only to  acquisitions  that  are Its  provisions made  by  notification  under have  no  application  to  acquisitions  made  under  either local  or  central  laws  unless  they  are  specifically  made .applicable  by  the  provisions  of  these  statutes. \u00b7Another  point  put  forward  by  him, the  Constitution that articles 31-A  and  31-B  of cannot  affect pending  cases  cannot  be  seriously  entertained  because those retrospectivity  is  writ  large  on It  is  enough  to  state  with  regard to  this  poiint  that  the  stage  for  issuing  bonds  has  not arrived  as  yet.

MuKHERJEA  J.-1  had  the  advantage  of  going  care- fully  through the  judgment  of  my learned  brother Mahajan  J.  and  I  concur  entirely  in  the  conclusions In  my  opinion, arrived  at  by  him. the  Bihar  Land Reforms  Act  of  1950  is  not  unconstitutional,  with  the exception  of  the  provisions  contained in  section  4(b) and  23(f)  of  the  Act  and  these  provisions  alone  must be  held  to  be  void  and  inoperative. Maharaja dhiraja  Sir Karneshwar Singh of  Darbhangrr and  Others. the  Bihar  Land  Reforms Act,  my  learned  brother  has  based  his  decision  on  the ground  that  the  provision  of  this  clause  constitutes  a in  enacting fraud  on  the  Constitution,  and  although to  exer- the  provision, cise the  Legisla- in  Schedule  VII  of  the  Constitution, tive  List in  reality  i:t  is  a  colourable exercise  of  that  power been  done  wliich thing  has under  which  a is that  entry  at  all  and not  contempleted  by lies I  agree  with  the  line  of  reasoning outside  its  ambit. adopted  by  my this connection and  there I  can  usefully add. learned  brother in is  nothing  further  which As  regards  section  4  (b)  it  has  been  held  by  my learned  brother  that  the  provision  of  this  clause is  un- constitutional  as  it  does  not  disclose  any  public  pur- pose  at  all.

Maharaja dhiraja  Sir Kanieshwar Singh cf Darbhanga and  Others. that such  attracts  the  operation  of that article,  my the  bar  created \u00b7by  cleause  ( 4)  is  confined  to  the  ques- tion  of  compensation  only  and  does  not  extend to  the a  public  purpose  which, existence  or  necessity  of though  implicit  in,  has  not  been  expressly  provided for  by  clause  (2)  of  the  article. For  my  part  I  would ( 4)  of  article  31 be  prepared  to  assume relates  to  everything  that  is  provided  for  in  clause  (2) and  con- either  in  express the  existence  of  a  public sequently  tl1e  question  of the  purview  of  our purpose  does  not  come  within enquiry  in  the  present  case. Even  then I  would  hold that  the  same  reasons,  which  have  weighed  with  my declaring  section  23(f)  of  the learned in impugned  Act  to  be  unconstitutional, apply  with equal,  if  not  greater,  force  to  section  4  (b)  of  the  Act in  agreeing  with  him  as and  I  have  no  hesitation regards  his  decision  on this provision  of  the  Act  though to  adopt a  different  line  of  reasoning  in  support  of  the  same. further clause the the  expre\"ion  \"arrears  of  rent\" clause include shall suits  were  pending arrears in respect  of  which on together  with decrees  were  obtained  before  that  date section  24 costs  allowed  by such  decrees.

Such  arrears  could not  vest  in  the  State  as  a  normal  result  of  acquisition of  any is interest it and con..:cdcd  by  the that  article 31-A  of  the  Constitution  has  no  application  so  far  as these  arrears  of  rent  are  concerned. The  arrears  of  rent, therefore,  are  the  subject-matter  of  separate  and  indi- I,,~nd  Reforms pendent  acquisition Act,  if  the  word  \"acquisition\"  can  at  a11  be  appropriate to  cases  of  this  description. The  restrains  invariably  are vate  property  is  taken,  a  pecuniary  compensation  must be  paidC1 ). Thus  eminent  domain  is  an  attribute  of sovereign  power  supposed  to  be  tempered  by  a  princi- ple  of  natural  law  which  connects  its  exercise  with  a duty  of  compensation(2). that  the  sacredness  of private  property  should  not  be  confided the  un- to certain  virtues  of  the  party  in  power  for time being,  the  Constitution-makers  of  our  country  have declared  it  as  one  of  the  fundamental  rights that  no property  shall  be  taken  possession  of  or  acquired  for public  purpose  unless  the  law  directing  its  appropriation makes  provision  for  compensation  in  the  manner laid down  in  article  31 ( 2). Clause  ( 4)  of  article 31  does  not do  away  with  the  obligation  to  pay  compensation ;  it merely  lays  down  that  laws  which  are referred  to  in clause  (3)  of  the  article  would  be  immune  from  judi- inadequacy  of  the the  ground  of cial (I)  Vi de  Cooley  on  Constitutional  Limitations,  Vol. The  clause  presupposes  however that  the enactment  is  the  result  of  a  valid  exercise  of  a  legis\u00b7 the lative  power  conferred  on appropriate  entries  in  the  Legislative  Lists  and  if  the legislature  acts  outside  these  entries  or,  under  the  pre- tence  of  acting  within  them,  does  something  which  is in  flat  contradiction  with  its  contents,  clause  ( 4)  of article  31  could  not  be  invoked  to  afford  any  protec- tion  to  such  legislation. and  the  real  object  which  the to accomplish  is  to  deprive a  man  of  his  money  which  is not  ordinarily  a  subject-matter  of  acquisition,  in  exer- cise  of  what  are  known  as  powers  of  eminent  domain by  the  State,  without  giving  him  anything ex- change;  and  under  the  guise  of  acting  under  entry  42 of  List  III,  the  legislature  has  in  truth  and  substance evaded  and  nullified  its  provisions  altogether. As  has  been  observed  by  Cooley  in  his Constitutional species  of  pro- perty  which and require which the  Government  cannot  lawfully  appropriate seized  and subject under  any  other  right, ~ppropriated  under Money  as  such  and  also  rights  in  action  arc  ordinarily this  List  by  American  jurists  and  for excluded  from good  reasons(2). But,  as  Cooley  has  pointed  out(3),  taking  money  under it  must  be the of  eminent  domain  when eompc\"'ated  by  money  afterwards  could  be  nothing mor-e  or  less  than  a  forced  loan  and  it  is  difficult  to say  Stat  it  comes  under  the  head  of  acquisition  or  re- quisitioning  of  property  as  described  !n  entry  36  of List  II  and is  embraced  within  its  ordinary  connot- ation. It seems  to  me  that  there is  no  difference  in  principle  between  them  because  a the  acquiring -chose  in  action  can  be  available authority  only  when  it  is  made  to  produce  money  ; Otherwise  it  is  useless  altogether(3). \"principles  on  which for  property compensation acquired  or  requisitioned  for  the  purposes  of  the  Union to  be or  of  a  State  or  any  other  public  purpose  is ( l)  Sec  Cooley  on  Constitutional  Limitations,  Vol. This  is  a  descrip- tion  of  legislative  head  and  I  agree  with  the  learned Attorney-General  that  in  deciding  the  competency  of  the legislation  under  this  entry,  we  are  not  concerned  with the  justice  or  propriety  of  the  principles upon  which  the assessment  of  compensation  is  to  be  made  under  a parti- cular  legislation  nor  are  we  concerned  with  the  justice\u00b7 or  otherwise  of  the  form  or  manner  in  which  such I  do  not,  however, compensation  is agree  with the the reasons  already  given  by  my learned  brother  in  his judgment  that  legislation  under  this  head  need  not  pro- vide  for  any  compensation  at  all  and  that  a legislative provision  which  declares  that  no  compensation  is  to  be given  comes  within  the  ambit  of  this  legislative  head. Taking  of the whole  and  returning  a  half  means  nothing  more  or less  than  . taking  half  without  any  return  and  this  is naked  confiscation,  no  matter in  whatever  specious form  it  may  be  clothed  or  disguised. The  impugned provision,  therefore,  in  reality  does  not  lay  down  any principle  for  determining  the  compensation  to  be  paid for  acquiring  the  arrears  of  rent,  nor  does  it  say  any-_ thing  relating  to  the  form  of  payment,  though  appar- ently  it  purports  to  determine  both. This,  in  my opinion,  is  a  fraud  on  the  Constitution  and  makes  the legislation,  which  is  a  colourable  one,  void  and in operative. con- tended  that  it  is  beyond  the  compentency  of  the  Court to  enter  into  a  question  of  bona  fides  or  mala  fides  of If  the  legis- In  a  sense  this  is  true. lature  is  omnipotent, tl:;i.e  mqtives,  which  impel  it  to enact  a  particular  law,  are  absolutely  irrelevant; arid Maharaja- __ _ dhiraja  Sir  ' Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhanga and  Others. on the  other  hand,  if it  lacks  competence  the  question of  motives  does  not  at  all  arise. But  when  a  legis- latU.re  has  a  limited  or  qualified  power  and  has  got  to act  within  a sphere  circumscribed legislative entries,  the  question,  whether  in  purporting to  act under  these  entries,  it  has,  in  substance,  gone  beyond them  and  has  done  certain  things  which  cannot  be accomplished  within  the  scope  of  these  entries,  is  really a  question  affecting  the  competency  of  the  legislature. This  could  not  possibly  have  been  the  real  in- tention  of  the  legislature  and  I  do  not  think  that there is  any  item  in  the  long  legislative  lists  framed  by  the Constitution  which  empowers to  inter- fere  with  the  legal  rights  of  the  landlord  in  this  manner apart  from  special  circumstances indebtedness  or otherwise  and  impose  upon  him  an  onerous  obligation to  which  he  is  not  a  consenting  party. A  legislation  of this  character  is  a  complete  novelty,  the  like  0\u00a3  which has  seldom  been  witnessed  before. There  would  be  no  order  as  to  costs.

In  England  Lord  Dunedian  in  Attorney-General  v. De  Keyser's  Royal  Hotel  Ltd.(2),  described  the  obli- gation  to  pay con- comitant  to  taking\". Maharaja dhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhanga and  Others. That  word,  by  itself,  according  to  Mr.  P.  R.  Das,  con- the  concept  of  a notes  a  compound  concept,  namely, power  of  taking  on  just  terms  and  confines  the  very the legislative  competency  under  those  entries  within If,  however, the limits  of word  \"acquisition\"  in  entry  36  in  List  II  and  entry 33  in  List  I  does  not  by  itself  imply  the  obligation  to pay  just  compensation,  then,  urges  Mr.  P.  R.  Das  in the  alternative,  the  words  \"subject the  provisions of  entry  42  of  List  III\"  occurring  at  the  end  of  entry 36  in  List  II  certainly  brings  in  that  obligation. On to a  plain  reading  of  entry  36  in List  II the  power make  law  with  respect  to  matters  specified  therein is the \"subject  to\",  that  is  to  say, exercise  of  legislative  power  under  entry  42  in  List  III. Those  conclud~ng  words\\  Mr.  P.  R.  Das  says, import for  compensation  as  provided the  obligation  to  provide and in  entry  42  in  List  III  into  entry  36  in last  mentioned thereby  enlarge  the  content  of legislative  head  comprising \u00b7  entry  so  as  to  make  it  a \\he  compound  concept  referred to  above. \"subject of that  obligation  as  stated import List above,  entry  42  in  List  III nevertheles~,  be construed  as  conferring  a  power  coupled  with  a  duty, so  that  if law-making  power  under  entry  33  in List  I  or  entry  36  in  List  II  is  at  all  exercised,  the  law- making  power  under  entry  42  in  List  III  must,  on  the in principle /ulus  v.

The  arguments  thus  deve- the  merit loped  by  Mr.  P.  R.  Das  undoubtedly  have of and certainly  call  for  very  careful  consideration.

There  is  no  doubt that \"land\"  in  entry  18  in  List  II  has  been  construed  in  a very  wide  way  but  if  \"land\"  or  \"land  tenures\"  in  that entry  is  held  to  cover  acquisition  of then entry  36  in  List  II  will  have  to  be  held  as  wholly redundant,  so  far  as  acquisition  of  land  is  concerned,  a conclusion  to  which  I  am  not  prepared  to  assent. In my  opinion,  to  give  a meaning  and  content  to  each  of the  two  legislative  heads  under  entry  Ht  and  entry  36 in  List  II  the  former  should  be  read  as  a  legislative Maharaja dhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhanga and  Others. tenures  and land category  or  head  comprising  land  and all  matters  connected therewith  other  than  acquisition of  land  which  should  be  read  as  covered  by  entry  36 in  List  II. to acquire  all  arrears  of  rent  and  a  la~ for  acquisition  of to  be  a the  arrears  of  rent  cannot  possibly  be  said in  entry  18 law  with  respect to  matters  specified in  List  II  for  it  cannot  be  supposed law to  be  a the  meaning relating  to  the  collection  of  rent  within of  that  entry.

Therefore,  the  arguments  of  Mr.  P.  R.

The  first whether  this  obligati'on  is  implicit  in  the  term  \"acquisi- tion\"  as  used  in  entry  36  in  List  II,  or  in  other  words whether  this  obligation  is inferred  simply  from the  nse  of  that  term  as  a  part  of  the  content  or  mean- In  Attorney-General  v.

Hotel  Limited  (supra)  Lord  Dunedin  pointed  out  that the  power  of  acquisition  was,  in its  origin,  derived from  the  prerogative  of  the  Crown  and  that  the  pay- ment  of  compensation  was  originally a  matter  of negotiation  and  bargain  between  the  Crown  and  the subject,  but  came  to  be  determined  later  on  by  statutes of  local  application  and  finally  by  statutes  of  general is application  and  that,  therefore,  the  Crown,  which an  assenting  party  to  every  statute,  must,  in  effect,  be regarded  as  having  consented its prerogative  being  made  subject  to  payment  of  compen- that  case,  however, sation  regulated  by  statutes. the In United  States  of  America  the  power  of eminent in  terms,  conferred  on domain  was  not  originally, Maharaja dhiraja  Sir Kam~shwar Singh of  Darbhangt\u00a5 and  Others. follows, that  the  expression  \"acquisition\"  does  not, therefore, by  itself  and  without  more, to import  any  obligation pay  \u00b7compensation. is  urged  by  Mr.  P.  R.  Das that  entry 42  in  List  III  really  implements  the  obli- two gation  implicit  in  entry  36  in  List  II  and entries  are  complementary  to  each  other. If this  obli- gation  were  not  implicit  in  entry  36  in  List  II then where  else, to  pay compensation  to  be  found  ? The  obligation to pay  compensation  may  be  introduced  as  a\u00b7  part  of  the a legislative  power  itself,  in  which  case  it  becomes composite  power,  namely,  a  power  to  make  law  with respect  to  acqui.sition  circumscribed  by the\u00b7  obligation 31 to  provide  for  compensation. There  the  power not  to  make  a  law  for  the  acquisition  of  property  sim- pliciter  but  is  to  make  a  law  for  the  acquisition  of property  on  just  terms  which  connotes  that  the legis- lative  power the  necessity itself  is  circumscribed  by for  providing  just  terms. Maharaja dhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhan ga and  Others. necessity  of  constitutional  law  that  I  know  of,  or  that has  been  brought  to  our  notice,  which that the  obligation  to  pay  compensation  for  the  acquisition of  property  must  be  made  part  and  parcel  of  the  very legislative  power  to  make  a  law  with  respect the compulsory  acquisition  of  private  property. What  do  we find  in  our Con- stitution ? We  find  that  under  article  246  Parliament inter has  exclusive  power  to  make  laws  with  respect, ulia,  to  matters  specified  in  entry  33  in  List I,  namely, \"acquisition  or  requisitioning  of  property  for  the  pur- poses  of  the  Union,  that  the  State  Legislatures  have inter exclusive  power alia,  to  matters  specified  in  entry  36  in  List  II,  namely, the  \"acquisition  or  requisitioning  of  property  except for  the  purposes  of  the  Union  subject  to  the  provision of  entry  42  of  List  III\"  and  that  both  Parliament  and the  State  Legislatures  may  make  laws  with  respect  to matters  set  forth  in  entry  42  in  List  III,  namely,  the the principles  for  determining  the  compensation  and form  and  manner  of  giving  such  compensation. The scheme  of  our  Constitution  obviously  is  to  provide  the three  things  separately,  namely,  the  power  of  making  a law  for  acquisition  of  property  in  article  246 read with  entry  33  in  List  I  and  entry  36  in  List  II,  the in obligation  of  such  law  to  provide  for  compensation article  31 (2)  and  the  power  of  making  a  law  laying down  the  \u00b7 principles for  determining  such  compen- sation  in  article  246 in  List  III. Maharaja dhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga and  Others. According  to  this  scheme  it  is  not  necessary  at  all in  List  I  and  entry  36  in  List  II, to  regard  entry  33 which  are  mere  heads  of  legislative  power,  as  contain- ing  within  themselves  any  obligafion  to  provide  for  the In  other  words,  it  is  not payment  of  compensation. necessary  to  treat  the  obligation  to  pay  compensation as  implicit  in  or  as  a  part  or  parcel  of  these  legislative heads themselves,  for  it separately  and  expressly is 31  (2). The  well-known provided in maxim  expressum indeed, a  principle  of logic  and  common  sense  and  not merely  a  technical  rule  of  construction  (See  Broom's Legal  Maxims,  10th  Edn.,  p.  443  at  p.  452). The law  of express  provision in  article  31  (2) acquisition, for compensation,  will, therefore,  necessarily  exclude  all suggestion  of  an implied  obligation  to  provide  for compensation  sought  to  be  impo.i;.ted  into  the  meaning of  the  word  \"acquisition\"  in  entry  36 in  the  alternative,  that  if is  not the  obligation implicit in entry  36  in  List  II  that  obligation  is  a~tracted  and made  a  part  and  pared  of  that  entry  by  reason  of the  words  \"subject  to  the  provisions  of  entry  42  of List  III\". The  last  mentioned  words  are,  however, not  to  be  found  l.n  entry  33  in  List  I  and  this  pan  of Mr.  P.  R.  Das's  argument  would  lead  to  this  anomal- ous  result to  provide  for compensation  is  made  a  part  of  the  legislative  power under  entry  36 in  List  II  by  virtue  of  its  last  few words  quoted  above,  no  such  obligation  is  attractedt and  made  part  of  the  legislative  power  under  entry  33 in  List  I,  and  that,  therefore,  in  making  a  law  with respect in List  I  Parliament,  unlike  the  State  Legislatures,  will not  be  bound  to  provide  for  any  compensation  at  all. \"subject  to\"  have  not  the  meaning  sought  to  be  given uo  them  by  Mr.  P.

This  consideration  was  not  material  in  connection  with entry  33  in  List  I  which  explains  the  omission  of  the words  \"subject  to\"  et  cetera  from  that  entry. Mr.  P.  R.  Das  finally  urges  that  if  the  obligation  to provide  for  compensation  is  not  implicit  in  the  word in  entry  36  in  List  II  and  if that  obliga- \"acquisition\" tion  is  not  to  be  read  into  that  entry  even  in  view  of the  words  \"subject  to .............. \"  at  the  end  of  it, even  then  if  the  State  exercises  its  power  to  make  a to  acquisition  of  property  under law  with  respect entry  36  in  List  II  it  is  the  duty  of  the  State  Legisla- ture  to  make  a  law  also  with  respect  to  matJters  speci- fied  in  entry  42  in  List  III  on  the  principles  that  as Maharaja dhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhanga and  Others. entry  42  in  List  III  confers  a  power  on  the  Legisla- ture  for  the  protection  of  the  interest  of  persons;  whose property is  compulsunly  acquired,  such  power  must, therefore,  be  regarded  as  coupled  with  a  duty  to  exer- cise  it. No  authority  has  been  brought  to  our  notice establishing  or  even  suggesting  that the  principle  laid \u00b7dawn  by  the  House  of  Lords  in  Julius  v.  Lord  Bishop of  Oxford  (supra)  has  been  extended  to  the  exercise  of Legislative  power  and  I  am  not  prepared  to  assent  to the  proposition. Entry  42  in  List  III does  not,  therefore,  impo~e  any  duty  upon  Parliament or  the  State  Legislatures  to  make  any  law  for  payment of  compensation. What  requires  Parliament  or  State law  for  compulsory Legislatures,  when  making  . a acquisition  of  private  property, to  provide  for  com- thereof  or pensation  and  either specify in which  the  compensation  is  to  be  determined  and  given is  the  provision  of  art'icle  31  (2). Entry  42  in  List  III only  constitutes  a  legislative  head  under  which  Parlia- ment  or  the  State  Legislatures  may  make  a  law  so  as the  obligation  expressly  imposed  on to  give  effect  to them  by  article  31  (2). In  view  of  the  clear  provision of  that  article  it  is  wholly  unnecessary  to  read  entry 42  in  List  III  as  imposing  an the Legislature  on  the  principle  referred  to  in  the  Hoose of  Lords  case. That  the  obligation  to  provide  for  compensation is not  included  in  the  content  of  the  legislative  power u_nder  entry  36  in  List  II,  by  itself  or  read  with  entry 42  in  List  III,  will  be  made  further  clear  when  we  come to  consider  closely  clauses  (4)  and  (5)  of  article  31  and article 31-A. It  follows,  therefore,  that  what  is  sought to  be  protected  by  article  31  (4)  is  a  law  for  the  acqui- sition  or  taking  possession  of  property  which  does  not, for  compensation  or amongst  other The  question  at once  arises  as  to  whether  there  is  any  legislative  entry in  List  II  under  which  a  law  for  acquisition  or  taking possession  of  property  without  compensation  can  be made  by  a  State  Legislature. Is there,  then,  any  entry  in  List  II  under  which  a  State Legislature  can  make  a  law for  acquisition  without compensation  or  pub! Obviously there  is none,  except  entry  36  in  List  II. If that  entry  by  it- self  or read  with  entry  42  in  List  III  has  any  impli- cation  as  suggested,  namely,  that  a  law  for  acquisition of  property  made  under  entry  36  in  List  II  without  a for  compensation  wiJll  be  beyond  the  legis- provision lative  compentency then there  is  no  other  entry  under  which  such  a  law  can be made  by  a  State  Legislature  and  there  can, therefore, be  no  point  in  making  a  prOIVision  in  article  31(4)  for protecting,  against  article  31(2),  a  law  which,  on  this hypothesis,  cannot  be  made  at  all. Article  31(4)  postu- lates  a  law  which  offends  against  31(2)  and  so  far  as  the State  Legislatures  are  concerned  there  is  no  entry  in List  II  except  entry  36  under  which  such  an  offending law  may  made  by the  State  Legislatures. This  cir- cumstance  unmiistakabRy  establishes  thait  entry  36  in List  II,  by  itself  or  read  with  entry  42  in  List  III,  ha.s not  any  such  implication  as  is  imputed  to  it. The law  wh'ich  is  thus sought to  be  protected  must  also  involved  acquisition of  property  without  any  provision. Maharaia dhiraia  Sir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhanga and  Others.

R.  Das's  contentions  were  correct,  a  law  for promotion  of  health  or  the  prevention  of  danger  to life  or  property  involving  the  acquisition  of  property without  a  provision  for  compensation,  which  is  what is  sought to  be  protected  from  article  31  (2),  can  never be  made,  for  the  obligation  to  provide  for  compensa- tion in List  II,  by  itself  or  read  with  entry  42  in  List  III,  and there  is  no  other  entry  under  which  a  law  may  be made  by  a  State  Legislature  with  respect  to  acquisi- f1on  of  property. It  is  futile  to  attempt  to  get  over this  anomaly  by  suggesting  that  clauses  ( 4)  and  (5)  (b) (ii)  of  article  31  have  been  inserted  in  the  Constitution ex  abundanti  cautela,  for,  if  Mr.  P.  R.  Das  were  correct in  his  submission,  no  amount  of  caution  was  necessary for  protecting  a  law  that,  ex  hypothesi,  cannot  be  made at  all. that  article  31-A  postulates  a  valid It law  made  by  a  competent the ambit  of  its  legislative  powers. If  a  State  Legislature in  making  a  law  for  the  acquisition  of  property  for  a public  purpose  under  entry  36  in  List  II  must  pro- vide  for  compensation  then  a  law  made  conformably with that  entry  by  a State  Legislature  will require  no  protection  ar  all agalnst  article  31  (2),  and  article  31-A  must  be  regard- ed that conclusion In  my  opinion clauses  ( 4)  and  (5)  (b)  (ii)  of  article  31  and  article 31-A In  my clearly  negative  Mr.  P.

Das under the  obligation  to pay  compensation  is  implicit  in  entry  36  in  List  II  by is  unsound. The  obligation  to  provide  for  compensation  being,  as I  hold,  a  provision  of  article  31  (2)  and  not  being  im- plicit  m  or  a  part  and  parcel  of  the  legislative  power itself  under  entry  36  in  List  II  read  by  itself  or  in conjunction  with  entry  42 in  List  III,  the  impugned Act  cannot,  by  virtue  of  article  31  ( 4),  31-A  and  31-B, be  called  in  question  on  the  ground  that  it contravenes or  is 'inconsistent  with  or  takes  away  or  abridges  any of  the  rights  conferred  by  the  provisions  of  clause  (2) of  a~ 'de  31, to  say,  that  it  does  not  provide for  compensation. Assuming  that  the  obligation  to  pay  compensation which  is  expressly  provided  in  article  31  (2)  \u00b7is  also implicit  in  entry  36  in  List  II  by  itself  or  read  with entry  42 respo!ldents  cannot,  even then,  be  permitted  to  call  in  question  the  validity  of the  impugned  Act  on  the  ground  that  it  does  not pro- vide  for  compensation,  for  then they  will  be  doing exactly  what  they  are  forbidden  to  do  by  article  31 (4)  and  the  newly  added  articles. TIJils  obliganbn  to  provide  for  compen- sation  is  no  doubt  one  of  the  provisions  of  articles  31 (2)  but the self  same  provision  be  found  elsewhere  in  the  same Constitution,  e.g.,  entry  36  in  List  II  or  entry  42  in List  III,  then  that  \"prorvision\"  must  also  be  regarded as  having  been  covered  by  article  31  ( 4)  and  the  two added  articles,  for  otherwise  those  articles  will  be  ren\u00b7 two  construc- In  my  opinion, dered  nugatory. tions  are  possible,  the  Court  should  adopt  that\u00b7 which Further,  it  must  be  borne article  31 ( 4)  which  applies  \"notwithstanding  any- thing  in  this  Constitution'',  will,  by  force  of  the  very words,  protect the  Act  against  everi in- competency,  if  any  arising  out  of  the  alleged  non- compliance  with if any,  of  entry  36  in  List  II  and  entry  42  in  List  III.

Shortly  put,  the scheme  is  to  start  with  the gross  assets  which  are  taken to  be  synonymous  with the  gross  income  and  then  to  make  certain  deductions therefrom  and  to  arrive  at  the  net  assets. Then  the compensation  is  to  be  calculated  at  a  sliding  scale  0\u00a3 rates  varying  from  20  to  3  times  of the  net  income. To the  amount  thus  determined  is  to  be  added  a  moiety of  the  accumulated  arrears  of  rent  etc. Ex  f acie,  it  cannot  be  disputed  that the  Act  does  prescribe  some  principles  for  determin- the  proprietor  c.r ing tenure-holder. It  is  said  that  although  it  is  well  known  that  the  per- centage  of  cost  of  management the income  of  a  small  estate  is  greater  than  that  of  a larger  estate,  yet  the  Act  provides  for  deducting  20  per- the  case  of  proprietors in cent. The  State  of Bihar v. Maharaia dhiraia  Sir Kameshwar Singh  . These  arguments, do  not,  on  close  scrutiny,  amount tha:: the  Act  does  not  lay  down  any  principle  for  determin- ing the  compensation. The  real  underlying  implica\u00b7 tion  of  these  arguments,  as  I  understand  them,  is  that the  principles  are  not  good  enough  in  that  they  do  .not produce  fair  compensation. All  that  the Court  is  concerned  with  is  to  see  whether  any  principle has  been  laid  down  as  mentioned  in  entry  42  in  List  III. A  landlord .is  expected  to  spend  money  on  works  of  benefit  to  his raiyats,  e.g.,  providing irrigation, charitable  dispensary,  schools  and  so  forth  and  be  it said  to the  landlords  that  in practice  they  do  spend  money  on  this  account. There- fore,  there  is  nothing  wrong,  when  calculating  the  net income  of  a  landlord,  to  deduct  something  which  the landlords  should  and  some  of  them  often  do,  in  prac- tice,  spend  under  this  head. been has It shown,  and that  in  many  cases  a the the  basis  of calculation  of principles  laid  down  in  in  the  Act  operates  to  reduce the  gross  income  to  a  very  small  net  income. To  take only  one the barbhanga  estate is  about  Rs. Maharaja dhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhanga and  Others. The fact  that  in  one isolated  case  the  calculation  may  work  out  in  thi~  way, does  not,  however,  prove that  no  principle  has  been laid  down. Indeed,  in  all  other  cases  the  principle  laid compensation, down however in  some to  be If a  principle  has  been  laid  down,  then cases. the  pro- visions  of  entry  42  in  List  III  are  amply  satisfied  and If no  question  of  legislative  incompetency  can  arise. a  principle  has  beeh that principle  does  not  in  fact  produce  any  compensation in  any  rare  case  or  adequate  compensation in  some then  the  real  complaint  should  be,  not  that  no cases principle  has  been laid  down  but,  that  the  principle laid  down  does  not  produce  what  may  be  called  just compensation. That the provisions  of  article  31 (2)  but  certainly  not  against entry 42  in  List  III  and  in  view  of articles  31  ( 4), 31-A and  31-B  the  Act  cannot  be  challenged  for  non-com- pliance  with  article  31  (2). On  the  other  hand,  even if i;t  is  held  that  no  principle  has,  in  fact,  been laid down  by  the  Act,  as  contended,  then  that fact  not only  amounts  to  a  breach  of  the  provisions  of  entry  42 in  List  III  but  also  constitues  a  breach  of  the  provi- sions  of  article  31  (2)  which  clearly  and  emphatically  re- lay quires down in which  the  compensation\u00b7 is to  be  given  and  a  breach of  this  \"provision\",  call  it  a  provision  of  article  31  (2) or  one  of  entry  42 in  List  III,  cannot,  for  reasons already  stated  be  questioned  in  view  of  articles  31  ( 4), 31-A  and  31-B. It  should  also  be  remembered  that article  31  ( 4)  by  reason  of  the  words  \"notwithstanding The  State  of Bihar v. Maharaja tlhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh \u2022f Darbhanga \u2022nd  Others. this  Constitution\" the  Act  even incompetency  arising What  I  have  stated  above  is  sufficient  to  repel  the the  Act  by first  ground  of  attack Mr.  P.  R.  Das. But  before  passing  on  to  the  second main  ground  of  attack  I  think  it  right  to  deal  with  a few  subsidiary  points  canvassed  before  us. It  is,  however,  to be  noticed  that  the  consequeunce  of  issuing  that  notifi- cation  is  that  the  arrears  of  rent  including  all  that  are mentioned  in  clause  (b)  of  section  4  are  also  to  vest  in, the and  be  recoverable  by,  the  State. that  right  by the  Act  does  contemplate On  the  authority  of  a  passage  in  Willis'  Constitu- tional  Law,  p.  816, that  the  power  of is  argued eminent  domain  cannot  be  exercised  with  respect  to money  and  choses in  action  besides  certain  other  un- is  .

It  ts  pointed  out  that  when  the  State  takes  away  a lac  of\u00b7  rupees  and  returns  50,000  rupees,  it,  in  reality, pays  no  compensation  but  by contri- vance  only thet  other  50,000  rupees  for nothing. This  argument  sounds  plausible  at  first  but is  not  founded  on  any  good  principle. This  argument arises  only  because  a  moiety  js  paid  back,  as it  were, If compensation  for  money  were m  the  same  com. the  value  of  a made,  say,  by  g1vmg  some moiety  of  the  money  taken,  the  same  argument  would that  could  be  said not  have  been  available  and  all would  have  been  that  the  land  so  given,  not  being equivalent  in  value  to  the  money  compulsorily taken away,  could  not  be JUSt  compensation. But  I  see  no difference  in  principle  or  law  when  compensation  for a acquisition  of  arrears  is  made  in  money. case  if  only  a  moiety  of  the  amount  of is returned  the  obvious  complaint  will  be  that  the  return is  not  fair  or  adequate  compensation of  50,000  rupees complaint for  taking  away  Rs. 1,00,000 and may  have  prevailed  had  there  been  no  provision like those  we  have in  articles  31(4),  31-A  and  31-B. This  debt  will  have  to  be  realised, possibly  by  suit  followed  by  execution  proceedings  in- volving  time  and  money  in  costs. Part  of  it,  quite conceivably,  may  not  be  realised  at  all. This, indicates  clearly  that  compensation  is  in to  my  mind, fact  paid  for  the  arrears  of  rent  and  I  am  not  prepared to  say  that  the  payment  of  a  moiety  of  the  book  debts as  compensation  is  so  illusory  as  to  amount  to  nothing, as  contended  by  Mr.  P.  R.  Das. Even  if it be  inadequate, the  grievance  will  be  not  that  no  principle  has  been laid  down  in required  by  entry  42  in List  III  but,  that  the  principle  so  laid  down  does  not produce  adequate  compensation  and  there  is, therefore, a contravention  of  the  provisions  of  article  31(2). That defect  cannot,  however,  _be  made  a  ground  of  attack in  view  of  articles  31(4),  31-A  and  31-B  for  reasons  ex- plained  above. Re Ground  B:  The  second  point  urged  by  Mr.  P.R. Maharaja dhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhanga  . The  contention  put forward  on  behalf  of  the  respondents  is  that  the  neces- sity  for  the  existence  of  a  public  purpose  as  a  condi- to  compulsory  acquisition  of  private tion  precedent property  is  not  a  \"provision\"  0\u00a3  articl\\! The  words  \"for  public  purposes\"  do  occur in article  31  (2)  but  it  is  said  that there is  a distinction between  a  \"provision\"  and  an  assumption. It  is  urged that  article  31  (2)  assumes  a  law  authorising  the  taking of  possession  or  the  acquisition  of  property  for  a  public that  the  property  shall  not  be purpose  and  provides taken  possession  of  or  acquired  even  for that  public law  also  provides  for  compensa- purpose  unless that  the  only  \"pro- tion. vision\"  of  article  31 autho- law rising the  acquisition for  a  public  purpose  must  provide of  property \"provision\"  only this for  compensation  and the that  cannot  be  made Act  by  reason  of  articles  31  ( 4),  31-A  and  31-B  of the  Constitution. This  argument  has favour with  Reuben  J.  and  S.  K.  Das  J. The  latter  learned judg- Judge;  after  referring  to  a  passage  in  his  own the  earlier  case  of  Sir  Kameswar  Singh  v.

Be an that  as  it  may,  I  am  prepared  to  go  further  and  say, fur  reasons  I  shall  presently  explain, that  the  require- ment  of  a  public  purpme  as  an  essential  prerequisite to  compulsory  acquisition  is,  if  anything,  essentially  a provision  of  tha.t  clause  and  an  integral  part  of  it. right  in  so far  as  it  protects  private  property  from  State  action.

Likewise,  clause  (2)  is  worded  'm  negative  language  in right  contained order  to  emphasise  the therein. of Clause  (2)  of  the  article,  in  its  positive  form,  omitting words  unnecessary  for  our  present  purpose,  w111l  read as  follows  :- may be  taken  possession  of  or  acquired  for  public  purposes such auhorising law under  any possession  or  such  acquisition the  law  provide  for compensation  for the  property  taken  possession  of  or acquired ............ \" Put  in  the  above  form,  the  clause  makes  it  clear  at once  and  beyond  any  shadow  of  doubt  that  there  are three  limitations  imposed  upon  the  power  of  the  State, namely,  (1)  that  the  taking  of  possession  or  acquisition of  property  must  be  for  a  public  purpose,  (2)  that  such taking  of  possession  or  acquisition  must  be  under  a law  authorising  such  taking  of  possession  or  acquisition the  law  must  provide  for  compensation and  (3)  that ment  of  a  public  purpose  were  not  a  provision  of it  will  obviously  lead  us  to  the  un- article  31  (2),  then tenable  conclusion  that  Parliament  will  be  free  under its  residuary  powers  under  article  248  and  entry  97  of List  I  of  the  Seventh  Schedule  to  make  a  law  for  ac- quiring  private  property  without  any  public  purpose at  all  and  to  the  still  more  absurd  result that  while Parliament  will  have for  compensation under  article  31  (2)  in  a  law  made  by it for acquisitio\u2022 to of  property  for  a  public  purpose  it  will  not  have make  any  provision  for  compensation  in  a  law  made for  acquisition  of  property  to  be  made  without  a  public purpose. implicit  in  entry  36  in  List  II  and that  the  existence  of  a  public  purpose  is  also  a  re- quirement  of  entry  42 in  List  III  which  is  made  a part  of  entry  36  in  List  II  by  virtue  of  the  words \"subject  to\"  etc.,  appearing  at  the  end  of  that  entry and  his  conclusion  is  that  in  the  absence  of  a  public purpose the  Bihar  Legislature  had  no  legislative  com- petency  under  those  two  entries  to  enact  the  impug- ned  Act  and  that  this  ground  of  attack,  is  still  available Maharaja dhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhanga and  Others. He  does  not  rely  on  any  other part  of insisting  on  the  existence of  a  public  purpose  as  a  prerequisite  for  compulsory acquisition  of  private  property. at the  end  of  entry  36  in  List  II  which  are  supposed  to import  the  provisions  of  entry  42 into entry  36  in  List  II  is  not  well-founded  and  it  becomes obvious  when  we  look  at  entry  33  in  List  I. There are  no  words  at the  end  of that  entry  as  \"subject  to\" etc. and,  therefore,  the  alleged  requirement  of  a  public purpose  under  entry  42  in  List  III  cannot  be  said  to be  incorporated  in  entry  33  in  List  I. It  would,  there- that  whereas  under  entry  36  in  List  II fore,  follow which  is  to  be  read  with  entry  42  in  List  III  by  reason of  the  words  \"subject  to\"  etc. in  entry  36  in  List  II the  Legislature  of  a  State  can  only  make  a  law  for compulisory  acquisition  of  property  for  a  public  pur- pose,  Parliament  may,  under  entry  33  in  Llst  I  which does  not  attract  entry  42  in  List  III,  make  a  law  for compulsory  acquisition  of  property  without  a public purpose. Such  a result  could  never  have  been  intend- ed  by  the  Constitution. The descriptive  of matters  comprised  in  entry  42  in  List  III,  as  a  legisla- tive  head,  are  the  principles  for  the  determination  of the  form  and  manner  of  giv'ing compensation  and is  described compensation the for  property  which been as for having cannot  possibly purposes. the  stated be acquisition for the  purpose  or of  property province  of  that  entry  to  lay  down  any  requirement for  the of  a  public  purpose  as  a  condition  precedent Further,  the reasons  for  which I  have  discarded  his . arguments  as  to  the  obligation  to provide  for  compensation  being  implied  in  entry  36  in List  II  by  itself  or  read  with  entry  42  in  List  III  will also  apply  to  this  contention  mutatis  mutandis  and  they need  not  be restated  here. To  put  it  shortly,  the  pro- visions  of  article  31  (2)  which,  as  I  have  explained, require  the  existence  of  a  public  purpose,  will  exclude the  implication  sought  to  be  read into  entry  36  in 111  List  III. of  article  31  as  to  the  necessity  for  the  existence  of  a public  purpose  as  a  prerequisite  to  compulsory  acquisi- tion  of  property  is  also  to  be  regarded  as  implicit  in those (4), 31-A  and  31-B  and  in  particular  article  31  (4)  which this contain  the  words  \"notwithstanding  anything Constitution\"  will  protect  the  Act  from  such  implied prov!S!on, already  explained. Mr.  P.  R.  Das's  second  main  point  must  accordingly be  rejected  as  untenable. that  there  is  no  recital  of  any  public  purpose  .

The  contention the public  purpose  must  be  something  definite,  something tangible  and  something  immediate  and  that  there  must be  some  indication  of  its  existence  in  the  Act  itself  and that  the  State  cannot  take  private  property  to-day  and say the  public  purpose  at  its leisure. We  have  been  referred  to  some  American  authorities for  ascertaining  the  meaning  and  implication  of  \"public is  of  a  more use\",  an  expression  which  obviously the  expression  \"public  purpose\" limited than used  in  our  Constitution. Apart  from  this,  a  perusal of  the  text  books,  e.g.,  Constitutional  Law  by  Professor Willis,  p.  817  et  seq.,  will  immediately  make it  clear Maharaia dhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhanga and  Others. limits  the  application  to One  theory  of  \"public  use\" \"employment\"-\"occupation\". A little  investi- gation  will  show  that  any  definition  attempted  would exclude  some  subjects  that  properly  should  be  included in,  and  include  some  subjects  that  must  be  excluded the  words  \"public  use\". XX,  article  39,  at caption  \"What  is  a  public good will  meet  the  constitutional  requirements  for  a  \u00b7\"public' use\"  can  be  framed,  as  it  is  in  every  case  a  question  of public  policy. The  meaning  of  ~e term  is  fl~xible and is  not  confined  to  what  may  constitute  a  public  use  at \u00b7any given  time,  but  in  general  it  may  be  said  to  cover a  use  affecting  the  public  generally,  or  any  number thereof,  as  distinguished individuals. Some  Courts  have  gone  so  far  in  the  direction  of  a liberal  construction  as is to  hold \"public  benefit'',  \"public  utility\", ' synonymous  with or \"public exercise  of mote the tude, order of  a  locality  may  receive view  of involved  are it sought the  natural  resources Mr.  P.

And  it  is  well  that  no  hard  and  fast  definition  was laid  down, the  concept  of  \"public  purpose\"  has been  rapidly  changing  in  all  countries  of  the  world. interest  of  the  community\",  however,  clearly  indicates that  it  is  the  presence  of  this  element  in  an  object. dividual  must  be  regarded  as  a  public  purpose. the shifting the from This  modern trend and  political philosophy  is  well  reflected  and  given  expression  to  in our  Constitution. As  I  explained  in  Gopalan's (')  and  again  in  Chiranjit Lat's case  (supra)  our case Constimtion  protects the  freedom  of the  citizen  by article  19(1)  (a)  to  ( e)  and  (g)  but  empowers  the  State, even  while  those  freedoms to  impose  reasonable res~rictions  on  them  in  the  interest  of  the  State  or  of public  order  or  morality  or  of  the  general  public  as mentioned in  clauses  (2)  to  (6). Likewise,  our  Constimtion  gives  protection  to  the right  of  private  property  by  article  19 ( f)  not absolutely  but  subject  to  reasonable  restrictions  to  be imposed  by  law  m the  interest  of  the  general  public Maharaia dhiraia  Sir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhanga and  Others. what  sounded  like  idealistic  slogans  only  in  the  recent past  are  now  enshrined  in  the  glorious  preamble  to our  Constitution  proclaiming  the  solemn  resolve  of  the people  of  tills  country  to  secure  to  all  citizens  justice, social,  economic  and  political,  and  equality  of  status and  of  opportunity. What  were regarded  only yesterday,  so  to  say,  as fantastic  formulae  have  now been  accepted  as  directive  principles  of  State  policy prominently  set  out  in  Part  IV  of  the  Constitution. The  ideal  we  have  set  before  us  in article 38 is,  to evolve a  State  which  must  constantly  strive  to  promote  the welfare  of  the  people  by\u00b7 securing  and  making as  effec- tively  as  it  may  be  a  social  order  in  which  social, economic  and  political  justice  shall  inform  all  the  in- stitutions  of the  national  life. Under  article  39  the State  is  enjoined  to  direct  its  policy. Surely,  it  is  to  subserve  the  common  good feeds  and  sustains  the by  bringing  the community  and  also produces  wealth  by  its  forest, mineral  and  other  r=urces,  under  State  ownership  or control. This  State  ownership  or  control  over  land  is a  necessary  preliminary  step  towards  the  implementa- tion  of  the  directive  principles  of  State  policy  and  it \u00b7cannot  but  be  a  public  purpose. It  cannot  be overlooked set  forth  in  Part  IV  of that  the  directive  principles Constitution  are  not  merely  the  policy  of  any  partic \u00b7 cular  political  party  but  are  intended  to  be  principles the  State fixed  by for  directing policy  whatever  party  may  come  into  power. Further, it  must  always  be  borne  in  mind  that  the  object  of .the  impugned  Act  is  not  to  authorise  the  stray  acquisi- tion  of  a  particular  property  for  a  limited  and  narrow public  purpose  but  that  its  purpose is  to  bring  the land  producing  wealth  under  State bulk  of ownership  or  control  by  the  abolition  of the  system tenure  which  has  been  found  to  be  archaic of  land and  non-conducive the the  general interest  of sets  up  a  Land  Com- community. This very  Bihar  Act  was  before  the  Constituent  Assembly when  it  passed  article  31  ( 4)  and  again  when  it  took the  trouble  of  amending  the  Constitution  for  saving this  very  Act. Would  the  Constituent  Assembly  have con- thought  fit  to  protect  these  Acts  unless  it  were vinced in  -the  general interest  of  the  community  '?

R.  Das that these  provisions for  want  of  a  public . of  the  impugned  Act  are  bad purpose,  I  am  not  at  all  sure that  I  would  not  have found further argument  that  the  entire  Act  was  bad,  for  it  might not  have  been  very  easy  to  presume  that  if  the  Bihar that  these  provisions  of  the Legislature  had  known Act  might  be  held  bad it  would  nevertheless  have passed  the  other  parts  of  the  Act  in that  truncated form. The  acquisition  of the  arrears  of  rent  appears to me  to  be  an  integral  part  of  the  scheme  and  inextri- Indeed,  it  may  well  have cably  interwoven  with  it. Re  Ground  C:  Mr.  P.  R.  Das's  third  point  is  that the  Act  constitutes  a  fraud  on  the  Constitution,  that is  to  say,  while  it  purports  to  be  in  conformity  with the  Constitution,  it,  in  effect,  constitutes  a  defiance  of it. The  Act,  according  to  him,  pretends  to  comply in  that  it  sets with  the  constitutional out  to  lay  down  certain  principles  on  which  compen- form  and  the sation  is  to  be  determined manner  in  which  such  compensation is  to  be  given but,  in  effect,  makes  out  a  scheme  for  non-payment  of compensation. The  Act,  he  urges,  purports  to  pay back  fifty  per  cent. of  the  arrears  of  rent  as  compensa- tion  but  in  reality  confiscates  the  other  fifty  per  cent. Further,  under  the  guise of  deducting\u00b7  4  to  12f  per  cent. All this,  he  concludes,  is  nothing  but  pre- tence  or  a  mere  shift  and  contrivance  for  confiscating argument,  when  properly private  property. to understood,  will  be  found resolve  itself  into  an attack  on competency  of  the  Bihar legislative the Legislature  to  pass  this  Act. It  is  the  absence  of  a  provision Maharaja dhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhanga  , and  Others. that  mak~ for adequate and to  Mr.  P.  R. the  Act  bad,  because, power  under  entry  36  in  List the  legislative Das, II  and  entry  42  in  List  III  requires  the  making of  such a  prov1S1on. The  failure  to  comply  with  this  consti- tutional  condition  for  the  exercise  of  legislative  power may  be  overt  or  it  may  be  covert. When,  however,  the  non- compliance  is  covert,  we  say  that  it  is  a  fraud  on  the Constitution,  the  fraud  complained  of  being  that  the Legislature  pretends  to  act  within  its  power  while  in fact  it  is  not  so  doing. I find  nothing in  the  Constitution  which  says  that  the  arrears  of  rent must  not  be  acquired  and,  therefore,  there  is  no  neces- sity  for  any  covert  attempt  to  do  what  is  not  prohibit- ed. Where, then,  does  this  theory  of  fraud  come  in? The  answer must  eventually  be  that  a  moiety  of  arrears  are  taken away  without  compensation. Why,  I  ask,  is  it  called  a  fraud  on  the  Constitution  to take  such  property  ? Where,  then, comes  to  imy  mind  is  that  it  is  fraud  because  the  Act the  baSiis  of  income provides  for  compensation  only  on at  present and, non-income-yielding rich very any  compensation potentialities  are  acquired  without at  all. Similar  answer  becomes  obvious  in  connec- the  deduction  of  4  to  12~  per  cent. provide  for is,  therefore,  ultra acquisition  of  the  properties  and vires. This,  to  my  mind,  is  the  same  argument  as  to the  absence  of  just  compensation in  a  different  form and  expressed  in  a  picturesque  and langu- the  question  of I  have  already  dealt  with age. absence  of  a for  just  compensation  while dealing  with  Mr.  P.

Accordingly, this  point  must  also  be I,  however,  repeat that  if  I  took  a  different  view  I  would  still  have  the same  difficulty  as to  the  inseverability  of  the  different provisions hereinbefore indicated.

Here  section  32  clearly his  contention  all  the indicates  that  the  Legislature  has  applied  its  mind  to the  problem  and  it  has  laid  down  the  principle  that the  compensation  may  be  paid  in  cash  or  in  bonds  or and  that  if  a pardy  in  cash  and  partly  in  bonds to  be  made payment  is either  wholly  or  partly  in these  bonds  may  be  either  negotiable  or bonds, non-negotiable laid the  Legislature  has,  by  a  rule down made  under  section  43  (3)  (p),  left  it  to  the  Execu- the tive compensation in the  manner  of  such  payment  of  com- and bonds pensation. I  am  unable  to accept  Mr.  P.  R.  Das's  contention that  this  amounts to  a  delegation  of  an  essential function within the  meaning\u00b7  of  the  decision  of  my  learned brothers. It  has applies  only  to  lands  acquired  under  that  Act. no  application  to  lands  acquired  under  other  statutes and,  therefore,  the  provision  for  compensation  of  the Land  Acquisition  Act . apply  to  acquisitions therefore,  the  doctrine  of under  the  Bihar  Act  and, In  my  opi- occupied  field  can  have  no  application. nion  there  is  no  substance  in  this  contention. For  reasons  stated  above,  I  allow  these  appeals. CHANDRASEKHARA  ArYAR  J.-The  faits  which  have given  rise  to  these  cases  have  been  fully  set  out in  the judgment  just  now  delivered  by  my  learned  brother Mahajan  J.  and  need  not  be  repeated. The  conclu- sions  reached  by  him  and  Mukherjea  J.  have  my concurrence. Maharaja dhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhanga and  Others. Article  31  (I)  of  our  Constitution provides  \"No  per- save  by  autho- There  are  three  modes  of  deprivation-(a)  destruc- tion,  (b)  acquisition  and  ( c)  requisition. Destruction may  take  place  in  the interests  of public  health  or  the prevention  of  danger  to  life  or  property,  but  with  this we  are  not  now  concerned. Under  the  Constitution,  when  property  is  requisition- ed  or  acquired,  it  may  be  for  a  Union  purpose  or  a State  purpose,  or any  \u00b7 other  public  purpose. When we  come  to  entry  42  of  List  III  (Concurrent  List),  we find  these  words :  \"Principles  on  which  compensation for  property  acquired  or  requisitioned  for  the  purposes Maharaia dhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh cf Darbhanga and  Others. of  the  Union  or  of  a  State  or  for  any  other  public  pur- pose  is  to  be  determined,  and  the  form  and  the  manner in  which  such  compensation  is  to  be  given.\" From  very  early  times,  law  has  recognized  the  right of  Government  compulsorily to  acquire  private  pro- perties  of  individuals  for  a  public  purpose  and  this  has come  to  be  known  as  the law  of  eminent  domain. But  it  is  a  principle  of  universal law  that  the  acquisi- tion  can  only  be  on  payment  of just  compensation. Indeed, almost in  a  free  government, rights  would  become  utterly  worthless, \"The  concluding  clause that  private  property taken  for  public  use  witltout  just  compen- shall  not  be affirmance . This  is  an law  for  the  protection  of blished  by private  property. in  natural  equity, founded and  is  laid  down  by  jurists  as  a  principle  of  universal law. all other if the  Government  possessed  an  uncontrollable  power over fortune  of  every  citizen. One  of the  fundamental  objects  of  every  good  government must  be  the  due  administration  of  justice ;  and  how vain  it  would  be  to  speak  of  such  an  administration, when  all  property  is  subject  to  the  will  or  caprice  of the  legislature  and  the  rulers.\" Bowen L. J.  said  in  London and North We~tern Ry. cannot  fairly  be  supposed  to  in- tend,  in the  absence  of  clear  words  showing  such intention,  that  one  man's  property  shall  be  confiscated for  the  benefit  of  others,  or  of  the  public,  without  any Parliament  in its  omnipotence  can,  of  course,  override  or  disregard this  ordinary  principle ...... if it  sees  fit  to  do  so,  but  it found  disregarding  it, that  it  will  be is  not  likely without  plain  expres1sions  of  such  a  purpose.\" This  principle  is  embodied  in  article  31  (2)  of  our including any  mterest  m,  or  m  any  company  ownmg,  any  com- mercial  or  industrial  undertaking,  shall  be  taken  pos- session  of  or  acquired  for  public  purposes  under  any law  authorising  the  taking  of  such  possession  or  such acquisition,  unless law  provides  for  compensation for  the  property  taken  possession  of  or  acquired  and either the  compensation,  or specifies  the  principles  on  which,  and  the  manner  in which, to  be  determined  and We  shall  not  here  trouble  ourselves  with  sub-clauses (3)  and  (4)  of  the  article  and  with  articles  31-A  and 31-B  which  were introduced  by  way  of  amendment under  the  Constitution  First  Amendment  Act,  1951, dated  18-6-1951. The  argument  of  Shri  P.  R.  Das  that  the  payment of  compensation is  a  concomitant  obligation  to  the compulsory  acquisition  of  properties  by  the  State  can be  accepted  as  sound ;  but  when  he  went  further  and urged  that  it  was  found  in  an  implicit form  in entry 42 of  the  Concurrent  List,  he  was  by  no  means  on  sure ground. examine itsdf  or must  have to  general  and  well-recognized jurisprudence. No  resort  can  be principles  of  law  of had  to  anything  implicit  or  hidden  when  the  statute makes  an  express  provision  on  the  same  subject. As just  compensation  has  to  be  paid  when  property  is legislation  has  to acquired  for  a  public  purpose,  the Maharaja dhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhanga and  Others. than  a power  conferred  on  the  Legislature  for  achieving  this there  is  no  duty end. For  any  statement that  the  payment  of  compensation  is  a  primary  condi- tion  for  acquisition  of  property  for  a  public  purpose, we  have  to  look  at  the  provisions  of  the  Constitution stated as itself  and take  up  the  unten- already. Mr.  Das  was  obliged  to able  position  that  entry  42  of implies to  pay  compensation,  as  he  could  not an  obligation otberwi:;e  jump  over  the  hurdles  created  in  his  way  by  \u00b7 sub-sections articles  31-A  and  31-B. The  learned  Attorney-General  contended  in  dealing with  entry  42  that  legislation  under  entry  42  can  also to  the  non-pay-.\u2022 lay  down  principles cited  Atiqa ment  of Begum's  case(')  as  an  authority  in  his  support. This to  be  as  unsound  as contention  appears Mr.  Das's  argument  that  the  obligation  to  pay  or  give compensation  was  implicit  in  the. If  the  principles  are  so  formu~ manner  of  payment. then result to lated  as the  legislature  would  be  evading  the law  not only covert- ly  but  flagrantly. that  under  the  head  \"payment  of  rent\"  there  could  be legislation\u00b7 providing  for Payment of  rent  is  not  a  legal  obligation  of  every  tenure  and  the circumstances legislature  can  enact  that  under  certain .or  conditions  there  shall  be  remission  of  rent. when  we  seek  to  apply  the  case  quoted. To  negate compensation  altogether  by  the  enunciation  of  principles. This,  however,  does  not  carry  Shri  P.  R.  Das  any- where  near  success. Article  31  ( 4)  is  the  first  stumbling block  in\u00b7  his  way. Therefore  the  bar  that  it shall  not  be  called  in  question  in  any  court  on  the ground  that  it  contravenes  the  provisions  of  clause  (2) becomes  applicable. As  if  this  were not  enough,  two  more  stiles have been  erected  in  his  way  and  they  are  the  new  articles 31-A  and  31-B  brought in  by  way  of  amendment. acquisition  by  the  State  of  any  estate  or  of  any  rights therein  or  for  the  extinguishment  or  modification  of  any such  rights  shall  be  deemed  to  be  void  on  the \u00b7ground that  it  is  inconsistent  with,  or  takes  away  or  abridges any  of  the  rights  conferred  by  any  provisions  of  this Parr: State, the  provisions  of  this  arricle shall  not  apply  thereto  unless  such law,  having  been reserved  for  the  consideration  of  the  President,  has received  his  assent. Article  31-B  provides :- \"Validation  of  certain  Acts  and  Regulations :-With- out  prejudice  to  the  generality  of  the  provisions  con- tained  in  article  31-A  none  of  the  Acts  and  Regulations specified  in  the  Ninth  Schedule  nor  any  of  the  provi- sions  thereof  shall  be  deemed  to  be  void,  or  even  to have  become  void,  on that  such  Act, Regulation  or  provision  is  inconsistent  with,  or  takes the  rights  conferred  by,  any away  or  abridges  any  of provisions  . this  Part, notwithstanding  any and judgment;  decree  or  order  of  any  court  or  tribunal  to the  contrary  each  of  the  said  Acts  and  Regulations shall,  subject  to  the  power  of  any  competent  Legisla- ture  to  repeal  or  amend  it,  continue  in  force.\" In  the  face  of  these  alm~t  insuperable  obstacles, Shri  P. \u00b7 R\". compensation  provided  in  the  Act,  if  he was  not able  to  convince  the  Court  on  his  main  point  that  he could  challenge  the  offending  Act  on  grounds  other than  those  mentioned  in  Part  III  of  the  Constitution, and  that  there  was  something  in  entries  No. The  acquisition  of  property  can  only  be  for  a  public purpose. Under  the  Land  Acquisition  Act,  I  of  1894, a  declaration  by \u00b7 the  Government  that  land  is  needed for  a  public  purpose  shall  be  conclusive  evidence  that the  land\u00b7  is  so  needed  and  Courts  cannot  go  into  the question  whether  the  public  purpose  has  been  made out  or  not. There  is  no  such  provision  in  any  article of  the  Constitution  with  which  we  have  to  deal. The provision  of  clause is  only  as  regards  compen- (2) sation  as  can  be  gathered  from  its  latter  part :- The  State.of Bihar v. Maharaja dhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhanga and  Others. The  existence  of  a  public  purpose  is  not  a  pro- article  31  (2)  as  a imposed  by VlSlOn  or  condition limitation  on  the  exercise  of  the  power  of  acquisition. The  condition  prescribed is  only  as  regards  compen~ sation. Article  31  ( 4)  debars  the  challenge  of  the  con- stitution.ality  of  an  Act  on  this  ground  but  no  other. Whether  there  is  any  public  purpose  at  all,  or  whe- ther  the  purpose  stated  is  such  a  purpose  is  open,  in my  opinion,  to  judicial  scrutiny  or  review. When  the  legislattire  declares  that  there  is  a  public purpose  behind  the legislation,  we  have  of  course  to respect  its  words. To  achieve  this the end,  several  provisions  have  been  enacted transfer  and  the  vesting  of  such  interest  m  the  State It  is  impos.\u2022iblc as  regards  various  items  of  ptoperties. to  deny  that  the  Act  is inspired  and  dominated  by  a public  purpose,  but  the  question  still  remains  whether the  taking  over  of  particular  items  can  be  said  to  be  for a  public  purpose. The  taking  over  of  \"arrears  of  rent\"  does  not  seem to  have  even  a  remote  connection  with  any  question  of It  stands  on  no  better  footing  than  if land  reform. Whether  realised  or  not,  they  are  his  moneys  due  and ryots. The  consequences  of payable to  him  by vesting  of  estates  must  have the tenures  themselves  and  have  some  connection,  remote though  it  may  be,  with  the  agrarian  reforms  under- taken  or  contemplated. Supposing  that  we  have  a legislation  stating  that  as  it  is  necessary  to  eliminate revenue  and  to  appor- rent  collectors  and tion  and  distribute  land  on  an  equitable  basis  amongst the . tillers  of  the  land  and  confer  on  them  rights  of permanent  occupancy  and  also  to  bring  them  directly into  contact  with  the  State,  all  moneys  which  the  pro- prietors  had  collected  as  and  by  way  of  rent  from their  estates  for three  years  prior  to  the  commence- ment  of  the  Act,  shall  vest  in  and  be  payable  to  the State,  could  it  be  said  by that any  public  purpose  had  been  established  for  the  taking of  the  moneys  ? Arrears  of  rent  stand  on  no  better them  over  is footing. conspicuous  by resort  was\u00b7  had  to for  augmenting the  financial  resources  of  the  State  or  for  paying  com- pensation  to  the  smaller  proprietors  out  of  this  parti- individuals cular \u00b7 observed  that  to  take  one  man's  property  compulsorily for  giving  it  away  to  another  in  discharge  of  Govern- ment's  obligations  is  not  a legitimate  and  permissible exercise  of  the  power  of  acquisition. Maharajit- dhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhanga and  Others. Sub-clause  (1)  of  section  24  no  doubt  provides  that 50  per  cent. This  means  one  of  two things the  other  50\"/o taken  without is confiscation is payment  of  any  compensation,  which the  con- taken  as virtually  or  (b)  50  per  cent. Taken  either  way,  it  is  difficult  to consists. Willis  say!l  in  his  Constitu- tional  Law  at  page  816:-\"While,  as  stated  above, any  and  all  property  is  in  general  subject  to  the  exer- cise  of  the  power  of  eminent domain,  there are  certain forms  of  private  property  which  can- rather  unusual These  are  corpses,  money,  choses not  thus  be  taken. in  its the  government in  action,  property  used  by governmental  capacity,  property  to  be  used  for  a  mere substituted  ownership  unless  such  substituted  owner- ship  i.s  a  more  necessary  use,  and  perhaps  trust  pro- perty  dedicated liens,  and  suits to  a  State,  mortgage to  quiet  title.\" II  of  his book  on  Constitutional  Limitations,  at  page  1117:- \"From however,  must  be  excepted this that  which  in  ordinary  use  passes  as  such, money,  or and  which reach  by  taxation, the  Government  may and  also  rights  in  action,  which  can  only  be  available when  made  to  produce  money;  neither  of  which  can to  take  under  this power.\" In the  foot- it  be  needful note  he  points  out:- The  State  of Bihar ;i\u00b7 Mahtwaia\u00b7 Jhiraja  Sir Kameshwar . eminent domain,  when  it  must  be  compensated  in  money  after- wards,  could  be  nothing  more  or  less  than  a  forced loan,  only  to  be  justified  as  a  last  resort  in  a  time  of extreme  peril,  where  neither  the  credit  of  the  govern- ment  nor could  be  made available.\" Nicols  in  his  work  on  \"Eminent  Domain\"  does  not disagree  with  this  view ;  on  the  other  hand,  he  says  at page  100  of  Vol. arisen  whether  money  can be been domain held  or intimated,  at a  state in or  a  private  corporation \u00b7  is is it is  not not  subject such  taking. The  use  for  which  it  was  needed  might well  be  public,  but,  as  compensation  must  be  paid  in money,  and,  if  not  in  advance,  at  least  with  such  ex- pedition  as  conveniently  may  be  had, the  seizure  of money  without  compensation,  or  with. an  offer  of  pay- ment  in  notes,  bonds  or  merchandise,-in  other  words, a  forced\u00b7 sale  or  loan- however  it  might  be  justified  by dire  necessity  would  not  be  a  constitutional  exercise of  the  power  of  eminent  domain.\" \u00b7 The 'learned  Attorney-General  sought  to  justify  this the  ground  that  it  was  a  compulsory acquisition  on taking  of  choses  in  action. Even  so, they  stand  on the  same  footing  as  money,  of  less  value  no  doubt  than if  they  were  coin  or  currency  notes. It  seems  that choses  in  action  too  cannot  be  so  acquired ;  reference has  been  made  already  to  Cooley's  observations. The  two  cases  Long  Island  Water  Supply  Company v.  City  of  Brooklyn(')  and  City  of  Cincinnati  v. Louisville  &  Nashville  Railroad  Company (')  do  not former  case, support under  a  contract a  Water  Supply  Company  was to  supply  water  to town  of  New  Lots  (which subsequently  became  merged  in  the  city  of  Brooklyn) in  consideration  of town  paying  for  hydrants to  be in  the contract. The  contract  was  for  a term  of  25  years. Maharaja Jhiraja  Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darhhan ga and  Others. The  obligation  of  a  contract  is  not impaired  when  it  is appropriated  to  a  public  use  and  compensation  made therefor. Such  an  exertion  of  power  neither  challenges impairs  its  obligation. Both  are  recog- it.\u2022  validity  nor it  is  appropriated  as  an  existing  enforceable nised,  for impairment  of  its  obli- taking,  not  an It  is  a contract. It  would  thus  be  evident  that  they  were  not  cases  of the  compulsory  acquisition  of  choses  in  action. Choses in  action  unrelated tangible  property  can  be useful  for  a  public  purpose  only  when  converted  into money. When it  is  said  that  money  and  choses  in  action  are  exempt \u00b7 from  compulsory  acquisition,  it the  ground that  they  are  movable  property  but  on  the  ground that  generally  speaking  there  could  be  no  public  pur- pose The  provisions  in  section  23,  sub-clause  (\u00a3)  that  4  to 12!
